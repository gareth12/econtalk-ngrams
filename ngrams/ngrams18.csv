1,a future in which were impoverished by the need to pay back money weve been borrowing they see
1,with the problem that what you and i might think are the good parts might not be the
1,within the profession let me put it this way i think there is clearly abuse and clearly people
1,a great classroom before no thats only one option for how you do massive open online education another
1,many people do we need to have a good society whats the right number thats again a very
1,measure performance attract better quality teachers principals parents and other teachers know within a range who are the

1,could be he is not interested it could be he has not gotten my emails if anyone knows
1,only wars can cause governments to spend enough to prove my case he wasnt saying we should go
1,your hand so easily now its easy the can has more aluminum not because people care about the
1,signaling model because i dont think it is russ so let me push back a little bit ive
1,of it would be becausei dont know if this has anything to do with your argumentits simply not
1,include the weimar republic in germany right in the 1920s guest yes that one actually peaked out in
1,riding down route 101 in a driverless car so i was proven wrong and i try to be
1,health care obligations we can imagine that it would have put the fear of god into the senior
1,of a cushion and you loved doing that enough but in general we would say thats not going
1,of a real issue you can see that in the last couple of years consumption has gone down
1,things in the satellite era weve been able to measure the absolute altitude of the sea level globally
1,if so under what circumstances but i dont think on the alternative weve done enough to try to
1,senate and signed into law but the 12is that monthly or is it just a coincidence that its
1,fundraiser russ yeah i agree guest and there just arenti mean elizabeth spiegel is fantastic at connecting with
1,in us along the ohio river in 1930s1940s also iron and steelrelated pittsburgh polluted cincinnati received the waste
1,provision that was not well known to the public and maybe not even well known to some of
1,the dominant way government is viewed is that true most people have a very low opinion of congress
1,evolved from that failed institutions are not recorded traditions trading rules in markets economic institutions underneath is where
1,bride book but not the one in silk road guest so i think my fear would be that
1,emphasizes thati wont say he says he doesnt like it but what he says is look the debt
1,place they are really not about sitting at the desk at all they put in a vocational school
1,lesson and my friend said yeah well as soon as i get off my cast im going to
1,not formally enforced but if you violate them in a way they may be even more powerful than
1,a lot aboutyou see more people coming into your store you dont know if thats because your product
1,and say therefore there will be no problems with externalities or therefore there will be no problems with
1,we at risk of heading in the direction of greece again its july 12italy was in the headlines
1,and sales tax revenue etc etc and so there will be a tendency toward a bias against church
1,its obviously the natural right way to do it but as you point out in developing countries in
1,nonguaranteed benefit and thats why we cant keep using these return assumptions because the return assumptions ignore the
1,would doesnt mean it is safe or that it should get an a but if the people who
1,on how much help you could get when your income was low or you were out of a
1,not true because if you look at the gallup data people in togo think their lives are terrible
1,makes it think what it really needs is transportation technology which is not at all what it needs
1,resources go away or even before the conflict is there and people are going to use the institutions
1,to attract these extraordinary transformational people who can change peoples lives 4905 guest we dont know the answer
1,that they dont have any interest in taking the best possible care of their parents in their old
1,their children and grandchildren but they also like the government to regulate the safety of drugs claim is
1,uganda wellpaying job teacher housing difficult bikes for teachers to get back and forth nice to build a
1,its not a referendum i dont expectwhat i thinki just think thats the wrong way to think about
1,and what do you exclude from gdp and the famous example is housework unpaid housework in the home
1,the rule of law guest im not for leaving the rule of law russ well hold on so
1,interest to repay it now all of a sudden lets say theres fierce deflation fierce so all wages
1,newspaper and it kind of seemed to remixing traditional media and only later did people realize that we
1,and millions of dollars of profit and revenue in a few sports i think mainly two mostly there
1,the trade deficit itself is still not a bad thing i would prefer and i think every american
1,the depression came first thing to remember is that nobody in the first months or even the first
1,called the job openings and labor turnover survey jolts which is relatively recent response to this work fantastic
1,the places that have less are going to stay about the size they are at and the places
1,is when you look at the policies and choices that are most consequential for economic development they dont
1,economy is not the right answer also i just had an interesting conversation with adam davidson from planet
1,that they didnt have to husband their economies in order to survive subsidized un to police the borders
1,more funds per capita than the large states and as for the implications for national policy and whether
1,that just kind of happens you dont see the market working hayek warns against the hubris of thinking
1,borders is actually quite easy fairly low cultural costsyou all speak the same language roughly the same religious
1,and more effectively he wasnt the guy i wanted to go out and have a beer with but
1,turned it down we wouldnt have any ex ante its a very deep point its hard to remember
1,this game i had that was given to me but if i take good care of it i
1,in ethiopia and elsewhere the idea of largescale targeted very inexpensive primary health systems being scaled up is
1,which kid had more natural egalitarian and informed situation from p 18 of hayeks the fatal conceit part
1,look at suppose you said let people pocket the difference how would we do that how would that
1,is the number of democrats has gone down the number of republicans has gone upsorry the number of
1,care costs more they spend more but i think other stuff is getting crowded out like higher education
1,a middle man part of the reason i might donate is i might want them to fulfill my
1,because you are not prepared to start trying to train if you are overweight basically so these kids
1,giantsstores like hm topshop even forever 21 which most people despise because they dont do anything creative with
1,an inevitable consequence of having a fractional reserve banking system much more common in the united states than
1,are taking a dipstick and you are just measuring how good you are and growth people on the
1,that you can call that an impulse purchase but its more like they are trying to make a
1,to quibble we are talking about way less than a penny per person in the united states people
1,all over the world russ correct guest no one borrowed money remember now savings has to equal lending
1,to bite into that governmentrun cartel or whatever you want to call itsometimes it depends on the city
1,have called from the state capitol that each school district has to have a serious evaluation system that
1,the labor market under the old rules theyd say you didnt even work that much before the recession
1,hes got a lot of baggage the old flipflop hes going to have a harder time in the
1,are not going to fight this war those other things would take place and some of those investments
1,comes in quite extraordinary maybe because of the sea airconstant wind coming in off the north sea fluffy
1,nba history both won the dunk contest i think they had other compensatory mechanisms russ so thats spud
1,maybe hes 17th or 19th but hes not 3rd or 4th he is a very outspoken man says
1,lead you astray if you are not careful on any issue so on the case of this relationship
1,says i didnt learn anything about being a lawyer in law school what you learn the theory of
1,government and now they are doing it with other peoples money so they are both affected by irrationality
1,everything for years and this past spring they won the national high school championship for the first time
1,capital toward housing which is obviously what happened in part and then the private sector rides the cycle
1,not ever going to behave the way the textbooks say it and other banks behave my focus is
1,to the wars and on the other the impending real estate debacle its very hard to see permanent
1,it was actually not the way people felt where the problem existed 5008 russ so do you want
1,well c not so well d lousy whats the right answer professor burkhauser guest well i think the
1,its the means to an end thomas szasz book the myth of mental illness 50 years ago this

1,that in turn would usuallydepends on the institutional rulesresult in lines queues waiting and that time would allocate
1,around wondering gosh are we under too much stress the stress we feel is a luxury the idea
1,of correlation doesnt prove causation either russ but there is causation so my point is that you are
1,knowledge is arrived at we actually dont understand why oral rehydration therapy works much better than antibiotics than
1,democracy on the other hand truth and beauty and so on and so those people dont want to
1,should focus more on keeping money growth from falling and thats what the kind of strategies that milton
1,dearly russ yeah it stinks russ so just to clarify what do you think if you imagined a
1,national levelnet worth took a hit most other executives had been selling stock right along jimmy cain had
1,happen they just said well well figure it out well work it out its not going so well
1,the economy and so yes certainly would be his explanation of those and of many environmental issues as
1,a lot of vertical control highly successful particularly in japan where commute times are long and you get
1,today thats an absurd argument but we are making the same argument look at other examples set an
1,on it simultaneously its a lot of feedback loops and controllers affecting it fractal heartbeat is a sign
1,that if you are bright enough and conscientious enough to go to college but you dont you are
1,from recklessness relentlessly and maybe there are some bad incentive problems with the way the fed was structured
1,government could affect say nominal income as a whole but in that example we wouldnt be any better
1,which is a nice thing if you are unemployed it went to keep teachers and other state employees
1,nothing like the difference between married and unmarried people or nothing like the difference between elderly people who
1,the best thing to do is have government spend government spending a trillion dollarsisnt that going to increase
1,constantly looking around entrepreneurship rests on awareness well i think the best answer to rawls and the people
1,conscientiousness in a certain obvious way if you dont do your homework sometimes that literally counts toward your
1,truth guest yes that is true russ so reflect on that guest that is true you lose faith
1,in a position where inevitably when things go wrong it doesnt hurt so much guest exactly as i
