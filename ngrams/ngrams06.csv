45,at the end of the day
34,i think a lot of people
30,as you point out in the
30,you point out in the book
26,there are a lot of people
25,i want to come back to
22,to the rest of the world
22,what do you think of that
21,and one of the things that
21,in the united states in the
20,if you go back to the
20,not going to be able to
19,there are a lot of things
19,you are going to have to
19,we are going to talk about
19,and so on and so forth
19,on the other side of the
18,what are your thoughts on that
18,i want to go back to
18,they are going to have to
18,russ our topic for today is
17,you talk about in the book
16,monetary history of the united states
16,the use of knowledge in society
15,from the point of view of
15,i think one of the things
15,what do you mean by that
15,make the world a better place
15,and there are a lot of
14,about what they imagine they can
14,what they imagine they can design
14,are going to be able to
14,one of the things that i
14,i think thats part of the
13,are a lot of people who
13,but there are a lot of
13,there are a lot of different
13,that there are a lot of
13,i think theres a lot of
13,they are not going to be
13,and i think a lot of
13,curious task of economics is to
13,the curious task of economics is
13,let me give you an example
12,one of the things that we
12,limited by the extent of the
12,and i think one of the
12,i think there are a lot
12,do you want to say anything
12,we are going to have to
12,in the rest of the world
12,but one of the things that
12,as far as i can tell
12,the library of economics and liberty
12,whatever you want to call it
12,one of the things that is
12,talk about in the book is
12,know about what they imagine they
12,but i think a lot of
11,we are going to have a
11,task of economics is to demonstrate
11,well put a link up to
11,there is going to be a
11,do you think is going to
11,going to be a lot of
11,has nothing to do with the
11,what we need to do is
11,that there is a lot of
11,for a whole bunch of reasons
11,are not going to be able
11,and one of the things i
11,relative to the rest of the
11,think there are a lot of
11,2013 russ our topic for today
11,by the extent of the market
11,you are going to have a
11,at the end of the book
11,in the united states and in
11,is that a lot of the
10,talk about what you mean by
10,want to go back to the
10,spend a lot of time on
10,so if you look at the
10,they are not going to get
10,over a long period of time
10,the right way to think about
10,that if you look at the
10,is limited by the extent of
10,you are not going to get
10,it seems to me that the
10,in the early part of the
10,a lot of people would say
10,lets put that to the side
10,what do you think is going
10,of labor is limited by the
10,to live in a world where
10,division of labor is limited by
10,always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon
10,labor is limited by the extent
10,of economics is to demonstrate to
9,i want to ask you about
9,lets talk a little bit about
9,you are not going to have
9,but as you point out in
9,is to demonstrate to men how
9,that one of the things that
9,the rest of the world and
9,i certainly agree with you that
9,really know about what they imagine
9,a lot of people argue that
9,what we are talking about here
9,you are not going to be
9,that have nothing to do with
9,you have to look at the
9,what we are going to do
9,but at the end of the
9,all you have to do is
9,economics is to demonstrate to men
9,have to find a way to
9,demonstrate to men how little they
9,put a link up to it
9,want to live in a world
9,what are we going to do
9,to demonstrate to men how little
9,this is going to be a
9,for the economy as a whole
9,to make a lot of money
8,you want to say anything about
8,that they are not going to
8,i dont think there is any
8,lets talk about some of the
8,in the united states i think
8,there have been a lot of
8,if you are going to be
8,think one of the things that
8,i think there are two things
8,that has nothing to do with
8,at the london school of economics
8,i think that would be a
8,theres a lot to be said
8,do we get there from here
8,what you want to do is
8,is always and everywhere a monetary
8,but it seems to me that
8,there has been a lot of
8,the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic
8,you dont have to worry about
8,off the top of my head
8,and if you look at the
8,the problem with that is that
8,you have to be able to
8,i think a lot of the
8,how little they really know about
8,a lot of what we do
8,of what we are talking about
8,you are going to get a
8,the bureau of labor statistics bls
8,from the rest of the world
8,the troubled asset relief program tarp
8,there were a lot of people
8,that we are going to have
8,i talk about in the book
8,the division of labor is limited
8,we are not going to have
8,in the theory of moral sentiments
8,want to come back to that
8,we dont have to worry about
8,but if you look at the
8,i think its going to be
8,is going to be able to
8,it has nothing to do with
8,one of the things i think
8,and it seems to me that
8,way of looking at the world
8,to do with the fact that
8,i want to start with the
8,on the left and the right
8,what are you going to do
8,i want to talk about the
8,its not obvious to me that
8,for a long period of time
8,our topic for today is the
8,they really know about what they
8,are a lot of things that
8,we live in a world where
8,you think is going to happen
8,on the other hand if you
8,there are a lot of reasons
8,so there are a lot of
8,little they really know about what
7,russ i want to go back
7,a lot of things going on
7,the president of the united states
7,i think theres some truth to
7,our topic for today is your
7,russ i want to come back
7,you talk about this in the
7,and as you point out in
7,a lot of people in the
7,one of the things that you
7,at the same time i think
7,in the united states we have
7,were going to come back to
7,let me ask you a question
7,there are a couple of things
7,is one of the things that
7,i think thats one of the
7,the best way to do it
7,way to do that is to
7,are your thoughts on that guest
7,federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act
7,causes of the wealth of nations
7,that has to do with the
7,what you are trying to do
7,does that have to do with
7,inflation is always and everywhere a
7,the way i think about it
7,if you want to have a
7,i agree with you i think
7,i want you to talk about
7,the fact of the matter is
7,and causes of the wealth of
7,what we are talking about is
7,in the united states and the
7,all we have to do is
7,you want to say anything else
7,the new england journal of medicine
7,so on and so forth and
7,that if you are going to
7,if you want to think about
7,what you have to do is
7,do you have any thoughts on
7,the nature and causes of the
7,and so one of the things
7,dont spend a lot of time
7,i think thats right i think
7,organization for economic cooperation and development
7,the point of view of the
7,and i think thats part of
7,to the rest of the economy
7,and one of the things you
7,there are a lot of other
7,and at the end of the
7,deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia
7,by the time you get to
7,are going to have to be
7,are going to have to make
7,at the library of economics and
7,i dont want to suggest that
7,to men how little they really
7,a lot of what we are
7,russ let me ask you a
7,men how little they really know
7,pay a lot of attention to
7,so one of the things that
7,way to think about it is
7,one way to think about it
7,it will be interesting to see
7,to make the world a better
7,one of the things that ive
7,i dont know if thats true
7,nature and causes of the wealth
7,want to come back to the
7,what do you mean by the
7,the london school of economics lse
7,early part of the 20th century
7,i want to start with a
6,russ let me ask you about
6,but at the same time the
6,i just want to mention that
6,the right thing to do is
6,trying to figure out how to
6,we dont have a lot of
6,one way to think about this
6,spend a lot of time in
6,has a lot to do with
6,the rest of the world is
6,more likely to be in prison
6,a lot to do with the
6,money from the rest of us
6,guest yeah i think thats right
6,are we going to do about
6,a lot to be said for
6,or whatever you want to call
6,and i think the answer is
6,dont know whats going to happen
6,there are going to be a
6,its just a matter of time
6,figure out what to do with
6,think thats part of the reason
6,you and i have talked about
6,the securities and exchange commission sec
6,and i want to start with
6,im not a big fan of
6,how do we get there from
6,of the council of economic advisers
6,as you point out there are
6,and you are going to be
6,people on the other side who
6,patterns of sustainable specialization and trade
6,to spend a lot of time
6,and this is one of the
6,at the beginning of the book
6,do you think of that argument
6,and you are going to have
6,decline in the velocity of money
6,right now in the united states
6,what you are saying is that
6,but at the same time he
6,are you going to do with
6,we have in the united states
6,the federal reserve bank of new
6,to get the most out of
6,and i dont think we have
6,you dont have to go to
6,what we are trying to do
6,whats going to happen in the
6,into the nature and causes of
6,are a couple of things that
6,in other parts of the world
6,russ and as you point out
6,going to make a lot of
6,and all of a sudden you
6,on the other hand there are
6,to try to figure out what
6,russ but as you point out
6,what do we know about that
6,you need to be able to
6,at least in the united states
6,and they are not going to
6,selfsufficiency is the road to poverty
6,dont have to worry about the
6,if you are going to do
6,right way to think about it
6,if we are going to have
6,people who are going to be
6,the people who are going to
6,likely to be in prison or
6,we spend a lot of time
6,one of the themes of the
6,were going to be able to
6,whats your reaction to that guest
6,think they are going to be
6,there are two things that are
6,its the right thing to do
6,this is one of the things
6,making the world a better place
6,to be in prison or jail
6,in the united states over the
6,thats one of the things that
6,what they are going to do
6,what i mean by that is
6,your thoughts on that guest well
6,talk a little bit about the
6,federal reserve bank of new york
6,do you think of that guest
6,an increase in the money supply
6,if you look at the history
6,topic for today is your book
6,the number of people who are
6,you talk about some of the
6,talk about this in the book
6,at the end of his life
6,i dont think we have a
6,inquiry into the nature and causes
6,as a lender of last resort
6,going on at the same time
6,i think if you look at
6,i want to get back to
6,going to go out of business
6,they are going to get a
5,by any stretch of the imagination
5,think a lot of people have
5,one of the fascinating things about
5,at the very end of the
5,do you want to talk about
5,i think its very hard to
5,the united states over the last
5,you can do whatever you want
5,live in a world where we
5,is going to be a lot
5,going to be one of the
5,thats the way the world works
5,i dont think so i think
5,what is going on in the
5,the right way to say it
5,want to say anything else about
5,the role of government in the
5,guest well i think there are
5,other point i want to make
5,well talk about that in a
5,take the job that pays the
5,a lot of the people who
5,so i want to start with
5,thats the kind of thing that
5,think there is a lot of
5,a lot of people who are
5,the problem i have with that
5,you take a look at the
5,what are your thoughts on how
5,in the rest of the economy
5,back 100 cents on the dollar
5,think thats part of the problem
5,and thats one of the things
5,the job that pays the most
5,think thats a huge part of
5,of what you are talking about
5,is that if you look at
5,are going to get a very
5,our topic for today is a
5,a little more complicated than that
5,turned out not to be true
5,that we are not going to
5,you are going to be an
5,a lot of people who dont
5,way to think about this is
5,i think thats a good thing
5,i think part of the problem
5,in the middle of nowhere and
5,i dont think we are going
5,im going to give you a
5,have nothing to do with the
5,the american society of civil engineers
5,not what we are talking about
5,at the end of the year
5,do it in a way that
5,in the united states as well
5,what do we know about the
5,the middle of the 20th century
5,for the rest of your life
5,what you end up with is
5,one of the things that happened
5,we dont have a very good
5,there is a great deal of
5,the monetary history of the united
5,russ i just want to mention
5,over the course of a year
5,to figure out what to do
5,the united states a lot of
5,hayek the curious task of economics
5,have a lot of political power
5,what does that have to do
5,there is no such thing as
5,are not going to have any
5,i dont know what the answer
5,as if by an invisible hand
5,there are many ways in which
5,way to do it is to
5,you spend a lot of time
5,if you just look at the
5,if you want to know what
5,what are some of the other
5,the united states in the last
5,at the state and local level
5,have some interesting things to say
5,there are all sorts of things
5,i do think there is a
5,im not going to give you
5,what kind of reaction have you
5,you are trying to figure out
5,2014 russ our topic for today
5,as you do in the book
5,that at the end of the
5,theres going to be a lot
5,and all the rest of it
5,the last 40 or 50 years
5,what you need to do is
5,both the left and the right
5,where do you think we are
5,i think thats a huge part
5,one way to do that is
5,as i say in the book
5,the onset of the great depression
5,there would be a lot of
5,be in prison or jail than
5,the food and drug administration fda
5,get rid of a lot of
5,make in the book is that
5,point i want to make is
5,dont think we are going to
5,but at the same time i
5,if you take a look at
5,dont know how to do it
5,by the number of people in
5,what we have to do is
5,russ i agree with that guest
5,and then on top of that
5,are going to be a lot
5,in the form of lower wages
5,they know what they are doing
5,its not just that they are
5,do we know anything about that
5,at the expense of the rest
5,and in the case of the
5,lets take the con out of
5,the rules of the game are
5,i want to move on to
5,are going to make a lot
5,the national institute of health nih
5,because i think a lot of
5,and i think this is where
5,and we are not going to
5,are a lot of people in
5,a matter of time before we
5,there will be a lot of
5,i dont want to have to
5,do you think thats going to
5,i think part of it is
5,russ what do you think is
5,if you are going to have
5,and i dont know what the
5,part of the reason is that
5,that you are going to have
5,what the rules of the game
5,and i think its a very
5,that you are going to make
5,i thought you were going to
5,are all sorts of things that
5,to that in a little bit
5,another way to say it is
5,done a lot of work on
5,there are still a lot of
5,and then we are going to
5,and i agree with you that
5,think theres some truth to that
5,and i think this is a
5,you have some interesting things to
5,figure out how it is that
5,for more than it is worth
5,its a little bit of a
5,one of the things i find
5,at the other end of the
5,would be to get rid of
5,it reminds me a little bit
5,i think a lot of us
5,a lot of time in the
5,to figure out whats going on
5,and there is a lot of
5,i think we are going to
5,and so i think that the
5,dont know what the answer is
5,had nothing to do with the
5,the last 30 or 40 years
5,take the con out of econometrics
5,what we might think of as
5,is that there is a lot
5,you go back and look at
5,what you try to do is
5,a decline in the velocity of
5,of what was going on in
5,i think its very important to
5,in the sense that they are
5,in the united states is that
5,and there are a number of
5,russ so lets talk about the
5,2013 russ were going to talk
5,russ i think you are right
5,one of the things that the
5,i think theres a lot to
5,let me ask you a different
5,i want to start with some
5,you have to do is to
5,a lot of money into the
5,the world a better place and
5,could make a lot of money
4,seems to be a little bit
4,from the international monetary fund imf
4,where do you think we stand
4,come to a group of people
4,think theres a lot to be
4,the best thing to do is
4,of what they are doing is
4,but i want to start with
4,then all of a sudden they
4,i dont think there is a
4,to do is the thing that
4,not going to be very good
4,russ yeah i agree with you
4,have a lot to do with
4,it doesnt have to be a
4,you are going to be very
4,what would you do if you
4,more than it takes in in
4,and we are going to get
4,there is a lot of stuff
4,but we are not going to
4,so on and so forth so
4,economic calculation in the socialist commonwealth
4,that there is going to be
4,if you go back and look
4,in the middle of the store
4,part of our present difficulty is
4,the last 10 or 15 years
4,me ask you a question about
4,dont have to think about it
4,something for more than it is
4,only a matter of time before
4,about in the book is the
4,id like you to talk about
4,the organization for economic cooperation and
4,think its going to be a
4,but the point i want to
4,if you want to get a
4,what are your thoughts on the
4,i think thats the kind of
4,make a lot of money and
4,there are so many things that
4,in the late 1980s early 1990s
4,got us out of the depression
4,they dont have any interest in
4,i have a little bit of
4,and you spend a lot of
4,the united states off the gold
4,im going to give you an
4,if you are not careful you
4,that i think one of the
4,think its more than that i
4,you think we ought to be
4,the end of the 19th century
4,a better way to say it
4,when i was in graduate school
4,you want to call it and
4,is that when you look at
4,both in the united states and
4,but if you are going to
4,think we can teach people to
4,we are going to end up
4,you are going to be able
4,we have a lot of people
4,in the history of the world
4,dont put all your eggs in
4,its a little more complicated than
4,do a very good job of
4,is the kind of thing that
4,it seems to me that if
4,russ yeah i dont know if
4,way to think about that is
4,a couple of reasons one is
4,we are not going to be
4,get to a point where you
4,at a point in time and
4,are going to have to pay
4,in the book and i think
4,going to have a hard time
4,you dont have to be a
4,seems to me one of the
4,so what you end up with
4,that we are going to be
4,that you are going to be
4,but at the same time it
4,to think of it as a
4,its going to be hard to
4,propensity to truck barter and exchange
4,were a lot of people who
4,all of a sudden you have
4,we dont spend a lot of
4,a certain amount of money and
4,so why dont you talk about
4,the fact that a lot of
4,do you mean by that and
4,who is going to get the
4,and the reason for that is
4,for lack of a better word
4,and it has to do with
4,you have to pay for it
4,good thing or a bad thing
4,and it turns out to be
4,on a case by case basis
4,if you actually look at the
4,is that a lot of people
4,there was going to be a
4,want to talk about some of
4,that there is no such thing
4,the bottom half of the distribution
4,the people who are in charge
4,i spent a lot of time
4,in the beginning of the book
4,i think one of the great
4,in the aftermath of the crisis
4,because they are going to be
4,you are going to get the
4,when you look at the data
4,the question is what do you
4,in prison or jail than are
4,the rest of the economy so
4,things going on at the same
4,i think one of the biggest
4,are on the other side of
4,in the united states guest well
4,that they dont have any interest
4,but if you think about it
4,russ i want to close with
4,put a link up to that
4,to deal with the fact that
4,i dont know what that means
4,not going to be in the
4,one of the problems with that
4,russ do you want to say
4,a lot of stuff in the
4,out in the middle of nowhere
4,we have to look at the
4,think a lot of people would
4,have to take that into account
4,why dont you talk about what
4,they are going to try to
4,in the united states it was
4,but if you go back to
4,which i think is part of
4,sell something for more than it
4,the manipulation of money and credit
4,and there were a lot of
4,there is such a thing as
4,russ so let me ask you
4,the expense of the rest of
4,lot of what we do in
4,because of the nature of the
4,a lot of what you are
4,an inquiry into the nature and
4,make it easier for people to
4,a lot of what government does
4,such thing as a free lunch
4,to make a long story short
4,of the economic way of thinking
4,we can do is we can
4,going to be able to get
4,you are going to see a
4,but they are not going to
4,that theres going to be this
4,but on the other hand it
4,we dont need to worry about
4,is based on the idea that
4,we can teach people to be
4,this is one of the great
4,chairman of the council of economic
4,that you have to have a
4,in the united states and they
4,going back to the 19th century
4,and were going to talk about
4,you have to worry about that
4,well get to that in a
4,fool yourself and you are the
4,that they are going to have
4,a lot of time thinking about
4,some interesting things to say about
4,in the case of fannie and
4,you are in the middle of
4,they are going to have a
4,you give the example in the
4,what was going on in the
4,the rest of the world was
4,hayeks use of knowledge in society
4,those with low levels of education
4,the theory of money and credit
4,why i am not a conservative
4,but i think you are right
4,but i think it was a
4,dont have skin in the game
4,that a lot of what we
4,i think its one of the
4,are citizens of the same country
4,fact of the matter is that
4,spend a lot of money on
4,think a lot of people who
4,the last thing i want to
4,we have to be very careful
4,at the same time there are
4,had a lot to do with
4,is something that a lot of
4,think of it as something that
4,the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement
4,and so on and i think
4,we are talking about here is
4,money back 100 cents on the
4,in the united states and its
4,the particular circumstances of time and
4,were going to run out of
4,are much more likely to be
4,if you come up with a
4,in the united states that we
4,at the low end of the
4,heads i win tails you lose
4,on one side or the other
4,an increase in the demand for
4,if you want to talk about
4,what we are going to talk
4,what do you think about that
4,whats going to happen to the
4,one of the things i like
4,you are talking about you are
4,the rate of growth of the
4,how to get the most out
4,and there are a couple of
4,risks for the sake of others
4,a very very long time and
4,thing to do is the thing
4,was a guest on this program
4,kind of reaction have you gotten
4,that we are going to get
4,i want to close with a
4,the worst thing you can do
4,talk about some of the other
4,no such thing as a free
4,in terms of the number of
4,the top 1 or the top
4,lot of what we are doing
4,russ what does that mean guest
4,fannie mae and freddie mac and
4,and you are the easiest person
4,they spend a lot of time
4,i think you are going to
4,i think there are some people
4,in the first part of the
4,the federal home loan bank board
4,so one of the things i
4,one of the things we have
4,the chief executive officer ceo of
4,and if you are going to
4,a lot of uncertainty about what
4,at the end of the month
4,what are they going to do
4,me ask it a different way
4,on the other hand i think
4,to figure out how to make
4,we are going to have an
4,so what are some of the
4,what they know and dont know
4,at 100 cents on the dollar
4,is not going to be the
4,for economic cooperation and development oecd
4,you think you are going to
4,to think about it in a
4,a lot of people think they
4,i dont have to worry about
4,whats your response to that guest
4,russ do we know anything about
4,an argument to be made that
4,but putting that to the side
4,out of the 18th century and
4,seem to be a good thing
4,yourself and you are the easiest
4,if you are not going to
4,i dont know whats going to
4,you are the easiest person to
4,so one of the things you
4,but it turns out to be
4,you can think of it as
4,put all your eggs in one
4,they are the ones who are
4,talk about that a little bit
4,one of the things is that
4,have to spend a lot of
4,it would be a mistake to
4,were in the middle of the
4,what do you see as the
4,i think this is one of
4,if we go back to the
4,is that one of the things
4,it seems to me that we
4,what we know and dont know
4,for a variety of reasons and
4,for a very very long time
4,is that a correct way to
4,i dont think we need to
4,were going to be talking about
4,one of the things i found
4,for those of us who are
4,so you have a lot of
4,because at the end of the
4,what do you have in mind
4,in the united states which is
4,were going to do something about
4,and you are going to get
4,as you point out in your
4,the fact that they are not
4,are a lot of different ways
4,i want to live in a
4,over the last 40 or 50
4,over the last couple of years
4,but when you look at the
4,has to do with the fact
4,so one of the problems with
4,i think you are right that
4,is a lot of uncertainty about
4,i think thats a lot of
4,me say it a different way
4,a good thing or a bad
4,if you want to be a
4,what they are trying to do
4,in the united states a lot
4,are more likely to be in
4,which i think is a very
4,to be able to do it
4,the case of fannie and freddie
4,think this is one of the
4,and then all of a sudden
4,on both sides of the market
4,send me an email at mailecontalkorg
4,there was a great deal of
4,do what you want to do
4,the repeal of the corn laws
4,the theory of moral sentiments by
4,in the united states we dont
4,there are people out there who
4,reminds me a little bit of
4,the beginning of the 20th century
4,thats just the way it is
4,if you are worried about the
4,i think that one of the
4,that guest well first of all
4,me ask you a different question
4,there are two ways to get
4,have to be able to do
4,of people in the united states
4,there is still a lot of
4,you get to a point where
4,in the book one of the
4,you look at the history of
4,a lot of time talking about
4,live in the washington dc area
4,what might we do to make
4,dont pay a lot of attention
4,has done a lot of work
4,to figure out how it is
4,there is a lot of uncertainty
4,they imagine they can design and
4,let me go back to the
4,there is a lot of evidence
4,russ were going to talk about
4,maybe well come back to that
4,one of the great things about
4,they are going to go out
4,the time you get to the
4,live in a world where people
4,and you are talking about the
4,let me give you another example
4,about the state of the economy
4,that a lot of people are
4,in the united states there are
4,our present difficulty is that we
4,the number of people in the
4,to make as much money as
4,but a lot of it is
4,im going to put you in
4,a bunch of people who say
4,one of the points i make
4,go so far as to say
4,i want to ask you one
4,let me ask you about one
4,the more likely you are to
4,would seem to be a good
4,is if you are going to
4,this is the kind of thing
4,that could be part of the
4,dont have to worry about that
4,you want to go back to
4,all your eggs in one basket
4,of the rest of the economy
4,get the most out of life
4,well come back to that later
4,in the last couple of years
4,of our present difficulty is that
4,people at the top of the
4,to men how little they know
4,the be all and end all
4,what we ought to be doing
4,the early part of the 20th
4,we are in the middle of
4,i dont know the answer to
4,take risks for the sake of
4,at the height of the financial
4,of them are going to be
4,example in the book of the
4,the height of the financial crisis
4,let me put it this way
4,to sell something for more than
4,one of the things that makes
4,one of the things he says
4,but i dont think we can
4,in terms of the business cycle
4,they are not going to have
4,have a very good understanding of
4,i think youd be hardpressed to
4,in the savings and loan crisis
4,you have skin in the game
4,there are going to be some
4,makes a lot of sense to
4,dont want to be wiped out
4,to be able to get a
4,in the united states and you
4,think there are two things that
4,there is an immense amount of
4,the world was coming to an
4,the other point i want to
4,on the other hand you have
4,i think for a lot of
4,the government would bail them out
4,what we can do is we
4,what do you think of the
4,i just want to mention to
4,united states off the gold standard
4,do you think we ought to
4,but on the other hand there
4,for a couple of reasons one
4,well if you look at the
4,are going to go out of
4,are a lot of things in
4,and those of us who are
4,you dont know what you are
4,that if you go back to
4,but there is a lot of
4,one of the things that has
4,to figure out a way to
4,led by an invisible hand to
4,relative to the size of the
4,that you are not going to
4,and get your reaction to it
4,what does it mean to say
4,there are lots and lots of
4,come up with a way to
4,policy on the part of the
4,somebody would have picked it up
4,going on in the united states
4,are going to be people who
4,in the aftermath of the 2008
4,so i think there is a
4,but i think its important to
4,you want to react to that
4,between the two of them and
4,are the easiest person to fool
4,i think one of the most
4,where there are a lot of
4,you want to be able to
4,the international monetary fund imf and
4,what do you think are the
4,question as to whether or not
4,to come to a group of
4,so i have to be careful
4,you talk in the book about
4,we were one of the first
4,of the rest of the world
4,who are the people who are
4,there are a number of things
4,what you are really saying is
