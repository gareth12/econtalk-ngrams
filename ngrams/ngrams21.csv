1,full circle medical issue back in the 1950s it was considered grotesque that people would get paid for giving blood economists
1,like wow thats a novel idea wouldnt that make sense and the thing of a genius is someone who when they
1,army and attack ny absence of resources makes it impossible and also tells us something important popular support for the war
1,we test for it russ i agree thats a stupid rule but why would they have that rule guest and the
1,want to head right would you feel that much better the fact that you dont vote i get to cast one
1,that the question is why the answer is obviousbecause of people trying to steer the system toward themselves or their ideology
1,are willing to spend millions of dollars on a 21 year old college basketball player or you know a 20 year
1,taxpayers made up the difference through the deductibility of that charitable contribution so that made it easier for them to find
1,lifestyles are but they live better than people in burundi no doubt nepal they do consume a lot not all of
1,good russ yeah its good but its interesting that we want to and that when we are anonymous we feel comfortable
1,i take this a lot more seriously than i used to is me just getting sick of having covered papers which
1,people recognize this is so important to get right and just get the right people in there that we can make
1,the subprime no thats my point in the expensive housing market no i think the right makes the mistake in blaming
1,and precision of the swing path in order to make good contact with the ball contact dominates in how far the
1,as you alluded to just now it implies a sort of gross materialismthat the goal of life is to make the

1,you said they had destroyed the tools that had previously been available so it was a government problem it wasnt something
1,in caves you have to generally stay warm at night on lots of the earth so you can be burning wood
1,too but the problem you get into is are people in a situation to distinguish between care that they really need
1,idea politics and religion people have these religious views what they do is they go out and find research that backs
1,some chess programs in america guest sure i just want to talk first about sports and i absolutely take your point
1,himself all these trinkets and smith asks does the utility that those things give him now does that actually repay in
1,in the story in which something happens to cause the whole industry to be off to get it wrong for example
1,people will think that transit covers its costs without even cost being defined like transit breaks even russ right like i
1,didnt agree with all of it but loved the idea of economic growth i think since the clinton years the democratic
1,to be outsourced you outsource them and you pay a lot less for the suppliers this is a wrenching process and
1,it but lets leave that alone theyd say well we cant fix that so what are we going to donothing you
1,maybe requires a thousand other technologies to create maintain and keep it operating and each of those might rely on hundreds
1,that would be positive for the economy its not like we dont have any tools we do have a tool get
1,not the right person because maybe you dont agree with it either this argument that somehow we are at their mercy
1,comes from the judaicchristian tradition this whole idea of purposiveness of having a purpose in your life that you should be
1,more for taxis than you would otherwise do if anyone who wanted to could go in and get a taxi inspected

1,book store how can people read the book right now you dont need a kindle or ebook reader to read it
1,partisanship youd think guest yes in the electorate but whats happened in my view is that at the elite levelat the
1,when we want to be creative that instead its really about different ways of thinking different kinds of problems so in
1,continuum and we go from one extreme to the other in the late 19th century shareholders not only had the risk
1,keynes in economic consequences of the peace also didnt want to be a policy person or politician leontief said what an
1,0 for my arrogance surprises some economists example you opened with wikipedia outperformed encartaunexpected economists would have said people being paid

1,they are rich is they spend their money carefully its not the only reason but its one reason and rich people
1,a year ago it was different or its different a hundred miles from here it has to be right here and
1,guest the thing about the former soviet union was they actually came to rely on the black market to improve the
1,wages are lower so some businesses will cut prices various subtle effects goes on until resources are employed continue until demand
1,thats a fairlyeven the regulatory agencies sometimes do that as well i cant give you precise data about when they stopped
1,didnt have market prices across all society russ the problem within the firm there was a big fad in business schools
1,than their children and those things yes those are a problem but they would be a problem if people were making
1,and health care to the uninsured then can give them a dollar amount based on the actual taxes they would pay
1,and i think a lot of us of this from time to time but rather than going on our phone and
1,always troubles about the distributional side if it gets too extreme and here is the way in which i start to
1,clause trust banks traditionally had this before federal deposit insurance what it said was in the event we need to you

1,through and we kind of had studies done on each aspect of the line all of a sudden you could grow
1,the long run certainly its plausible that they could be harmed in the short run and my thought about that isand
1,to be a good teacher i want to put that on the table however the wage they earn if they go
1,taxes helps to finance the rise of the netherlands in the 17th century important trading nation and the first real republic
1,dig this ditch for five days well give you a permanent government job with a good salary for the rest of
1,a group what they really want to do because there is no residual claimant like there would be for someone in
1,look different guest well theres one line of thinking thats very popular among academic economists which is to say lets look
1,you start getting fatter if your fat tissue starts growing youll take in more energy than you expend so dysregulation of
1,the big issues in the book other than this issue of ideology and mentality the title of the book is the
1,cheap system and a system that avoids negotiations is one that saves a lot of costs russ so one of the
1,so yes valve operates like a good academic department one that does not have a lot of dead wood russ yeah
1,showed priming is true as everyone knows guest right there are a couple of problems here i ended up writing a

1,children if their children came home hungry every day and in rags after they sent them out well clothed and fed

1,down well seem to do a pretty good job of it the modern judges are much more inclined to be outraged
1,freedom of contract in private property but would be the political oversight that takes place by virtue of general popular election
1,gueste better than some flights ive had on delta airlines seriously its not as bad as you might think russ as
1,system it is certainly true that we have createda tragedy of the commons an externality what you call an inefficiencythat in
1,it would have been to support markets not to individual institutions and the bankruptcy would have gotten resolved how much sympathy
1,for the general public and helping politicians keynes writes a book that he claims at least is for economists for his
1,high it turned out you bled out all of the difficulties associated with the system and the recovery began in 1922
1,take on the characteristics of digital objects so let me just give you an example i have a coffee cup in

1,are favoring lets say you oppose redistribution and favor sticking to free market principles here that its got these limitations or
1,churches that are unofficial that they try to stamp out and then there is this gray market in there those are

1,creative destruction there is a lot of destruction in profitseeking if thats all you look at might be easy to conclude
1,some kind of wage subsidy but those come out of budget so its much more attractive for politicians to just mandate
1,that people have done in the last 30 years but in 20 years it may all be irrelevant so the best
1,everyone else was charging now one of the things thats unusual and weve talked about this a lot in previous podcastsif
1,new york there are a lot of efficiencies there in fact new yorkers emit far less carbon than people who live
1,hurts me i can sue you whereas in europe there is some opportunity for that but in the vast majority of
1,to eat very concrete engineering questions interestingly when i lay the whole premise out in front of students they usually come
1,it would offset some of the human impact guestc okay geoengineering now is a different kind of question thats where you
1,easily see what the changes were in your case if there was some funky code checked into the source tree that
1,had been running went broke yesthe wonderful name of enhanced leverage fundhighgrade structured credit strategies enhanced leverage fundthats what i mean
1,they absolutely wanted to make sure they didnt repeat that strong antiinflation stance what from our current vantage point might seem
1,approach use different techniques to try and get a sense of whats happening and im convinced actually that in fact things
1,that require frequent setup changes so if you think of the fuel injector ford has a different kind of fuel injector
1,absolutely loved which is now some say we should actually look at what happened we should have gone and seen what
1,and i googled nassim looking for interviews with him to see what other content and on his website fooled by randomness
1,you know russ less guest right not very much the old saying in agricultural economic circles is there isnt much wheat
1,eg gary becker macroeconomics is that branch that examines how all these microeconomic decisions hang together how the pencil comes about
1,as from a wellcontrived machine have to think about how this fits into the grand scheme of things longterm consequences precedents
1,inherent virtue worthy of requirement those who promote buying local present themselves as progressives but it seems hostile to those who
1,now have to depend on regulators bankers have lobbied against reforms that have been proposed combination of subsidizing risks in the
1,recharge its batteries i had the opportunity to stand between it and the plug that it wanted i could feel its
1,anyone who wanted to could go in and get a taxi inspected and licensed and so forth than if other people
1,i dont have any trouble with accepting the realityand any parent who has more than one child who is not a
1,will make things worse and you will end up throwing people in jail for being in the black market or for
1,ended up being 825 billion i think it was a mixture of spending and some tax rebates about 13 each13 tax
1,pray and i really feel im in touch with god or something so its an allegory the question is is it
1,correlates supply and demand through price we have infinite demands because we all want congestionfree roads and we all believe we
1,top so keynes missed that point keynes seemed to think that so long as he and his friends from cambridge were
1,cant make up a product that someone would want this is a mistake companies make programmers translate their ideas into code
1,he kept insisting over and over again that we at aig shouldnt have to pay a penny to goldman because the
1,take a jar of coins that youve dumped into a jar pour it into this machine and it will sort out
1,let the economy slide partly under this oil shock and partly because of the housing crash and by the time they
1,have not done anything with it once they do the presumption is that the money supply increases will then translate into
1,test group versus the control group it went down extremely slightly russ for the group that went up thoughfor either of
1,and how to sort out that out remains rather unclear and there are differing interpretations in the scientific literature so thats
1,may be in two exactly or you may be in dozens and i may be in dozens of various different kinds
1,nation there is no question about that russ correct guest but then when you look at the statistic this is the
1,now it would be less intrusive to have these things built in than to force you to go online on your
1,attempt guest yeah were not defending the other side either you see the same thing in the debate about this immigration
1,journal saying is this an exciting innovative enough result for us to publish the review process is solely about the soundness
1,would actually be giving you less economic value than the dollar value of the aid that was disbursed russ right guest
1,has resources but the landlocked resourcescarce countries are the most impoverished within africa its about a third of the population outside
1,hard to think of any sector of the economy that is not important does government involvement make it work better or
1,find that wealth goes down because of the incentive problems who is going to do the hard or unpleasant jobswhy is
1,the economy does very badly we are in that period where around the world things have been bad for a long
1,before i get started i want to mention i recently hosted an event at butler university that was cosponsored with liberty
1,put mirrors on these grocery carts so that you could lookand its from underneathso that you could see the fat under
1,interests are also involved and some people feel their work is very useful in a concrete way either driven by idealistic
1,on the great depression back to the 1920s runup to the depression have to go back to 1919 new system of
1,circles i dont want to be one of those people who doesnt like children and my answer is always i like
1,is put to death why not because to punish people as a deterrent because no inspector no regulator nobody will ever
1,fannie are adequately capitalized and also that they meet affordable housing goals certain portion of their purchases each year must support
1,moved elsewhere they disappeared and as industry fled there was often a fiscal crisis that ensued because the tax base had
1,checks in the mail not alterations in the marginal rate guest thats right the changes that we saw in the tax
1,ever go up russ yeah theyd shut it down guest so its changing dramatically in this decade and its very exciting
1,suchandsuch a magnitude and is not due to chance what is hidden from us as the readers and is the unspoken
1,to make plans dont undersell businesses but there comes a point where it gets a lot harder consumers pay the price
1,and right not the returns are highest in the emerging markets where returns are dynamic not in the american economy thats
1,newsweek if you asked people to name an economist thats who theyd come up with today an enormously larger group of
1,talking about new york city or washington dc 842 so the government looked at this bus system and thought there was
1,just one copy then you are protected from cerebral malaria which is the kind of malaria that kills you so those
1,is your assessmentunderstanding that its yours what questions are left unanswered simple analysis looked at performance on national assessment of educational
1,not inflating but causing other countries to deflate if there had been this balance france inflating and other countries deflating balance
1,understanding what were missing is the insights into these problems but there are plenty of things we dont understandruss so youre
1,point of view about our politics that has always been part of it that has always been here that was very

1,living within limits commitment to family observed not to be part of the oppressive system but were constituent elements of a
1,accept bitcoins and use them freely guest so here in thefirst i should say it varies depending on where you are
1,even political power raw business power we did it by reporting our conclusion about fanny and freddie i suspect is not
1,is science and this is not grants to professors vs grants to students in innovation its great to free up the
1,growth or risktaking wonder if some of your pessimism is really a shortrun pessimism as opposed to a seachange i think
1,innovation going on in an economy you are always going to have people who are large winners and thats going to
1,that affects how people measure the return to education and why its so important is there anything you can do about
1,price under the current situation guest i heard an anecdote that may be an urban legend but i thought i would

1,only then would there be a substitute for the tax on liquor don boudreauxs work with adam pritchard1930s when the income

1,of place those three things all sort of rely on a deep understanding of the way market price is derived 5842
1,earlier than that but its so important to get that straight russ i would encourage members of the federal reserve to
1,certainly served the keynesian agenda and people who accepted it were keynesians they bought into it because if you bought into
1,people in the organization guest the problem that athletes face is twofold the first is that you can go into a

1,of them according to the studies which we cite and there are tables and pie charts in the book which show
1,same thing as everyone else where are you going to put your money instead if everybodys under the same compensation rules

1,running these defined benefit systems you are still running these imbalanced budgets and that savings that you just earned that you
1,the worst thing in the world it is if it leads to bigger inflation and if it leads to wide swings
1,5070 i do a lot of education writ large or try to i ask you the question because theres a certain
1,not responding in the way that incentives in a normallyfunctioning institution would operate under competitive forces then we have to ask
1,think its fine limits to have often you can reinvent camden yards its a perfectly serviceable new ballpark yeah thats my
1,those of us who are below the median that strategy is not a productive one solets do this briefly because i
1,time in the future when we are going to have an extraordinary standard of living our biggest challenge is going to
1,of different products and services that didnt exist economy faced with this reality which its creating in an emergent hayekian way
1,of that having said that its not obvious what the implication of any of this is people who like bigger government
1,is if you cut a starfish up into 5 bits you get 5 starfish the danger of a spider is that
1,these books and they were looking at them and then a day came when my son felt he needed some money
1,wonder about the execution simplest way to think about it is that suppose you have a situation where people are afraid
1,you could take a persons brain out of their head while they were still alive are you going to be able
1,from appreciating and obtaining an export market has worked fairly well for them so far in addition to accumulating huge dollar
1,do that by having an effect on incentives and information but ideas are ultimately what its all about and so when
1,to the very means by which improvement could happen the idea that you would have a total break with the past
1,the great economist john maynard keynes who wrote a little pamphlet which many economists know called economic lessons possibilitieseconlib ed for
1,means you have to kind of trust the income distribution of african economies today so you have to kind of think
1,not all commodities at once friedman helicopter might have more money but prices would adjust in general wouldnt fix poverty what
1,there is a generalized flight to safety and then you have the liquidity trap and so on and so forth so
1,maybe it really does use the same part of the brain russ its very possible i think its the creative part
1,examples we understand much better the big picturesimply that free societies have a much better outcome than autocratic societies thats really
1,are the most exciting areas in research on this topic of growth that have the most promise work in political economy
1,future uncertaintyreference in rap video we are about to hear believe keynes was wrong that that was what causes business cycles
1,my mind as an economist is the way some macroeconomists talk about stimulus spending or government spending we just need toor
1,there are pathological things microorganisms viruses tumors physical measurable things that go wrong with the body and we know how to
1,a little bit here or there but most of what they are there for is to protect what they have already
1,allocation of capital improved in the 2000s or 1990s compared to where it was in the 1950s and 1960s when i
1,them and youve got a picture of a duck but thats not the way intelligence works intelligence is you have a
1,they didnt get some things right there are some terrific things in the constitution and just to clarify i did not
1,always produce outcomes that are best from the perspective of the group and thats the darwinian understanding of competition that i
1,over the last century technology and growth shortcoming of economics textbooks and courses kling economics 20 misunderstanding of wellbeing movie or
1,pins better its that as transportation costs fall as the economy improves you get these predictions that people for interregional trade
1,heard it he got about two sentences into it and johnny carson cut him off not intellectual property how many people
1,encourage equally young economists out there to remember that not everything valuable can be quantified and if you cant ever measure
1,ways and we find liberals very protective of every last inch of the welfare state but i think that that is

1,is the school costs 5 million a year to run and the average amount of scholarships of the graduating class if
1,should say i think we would tell the story as economists about borders moving in a certain direction there and it
1,to realize is theres a standard by which to measure whether the fed did enough and that is what did the
1,ultimately fail but only after a long time 2632 what was the civil war fought over was it slavery or was
