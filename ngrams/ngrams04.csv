775,in the united states
486,a lot of people
405,you are going to
374,one of the things
353,we are going to
300,if you look at
297,are going to be
292,they are going to
252,is going to be
240,at the same time
232,a lot of the
230,to be able to
215,are not going to
207,you look at the
201,are a lot of
201,the end of the
199,if you want to
197,theres a lot of
195,there are a lot
184,are going to have
184,a lot of money
183,at the end of
177,have a lot of
173,we are talking about
171,the rest of the
169,as you point out
164,you are talking about
162,a little bit of
160,of the things that
155,what do you think
149,not going to be
148,the united states and
145,in terms of the
140,going to be a
136,in the case of
129,are going to get
128,i dont want to
128,it seems to me
128,and one of the
127,going to have to
126,when you look at
125,in a way that
124,its going to be
123,that a lot of
123,on the other hand
114,in the sense that
113,i dont know if
113,if you have a
112,is one of the
109,for a long time
109,the people who are
108,i think thats a
108,go back to the
106,and i think that
104,you dont have to
104,is a lot of
103,i think its a
102,in a lot of
101,and a lot of
100,in the middle of
100,im not going to
99,and i think thats
99,if you are a
97,to do with the
97,i think there are
96,all of a sudden
96,one of the most
93,way to think about
93,on the other side
93,i think it was
93,a lot of things
92,nothing to do with
92,and i think the
92,of the united states
91,one of the reasons
90,a lot of time
88,i agree with you
87,there is a lot
87,that there is a
87,to think about it
86,and i think its
85,but a lot of
83,think a lot of
83,the fact that the
82,and i want to
81,which i think is
81,the united states is
79,but i want to
79,i think a lot
79,to go back to
79,you are trying to
78,part of the reason
78,the size of the
77,rest of the world
77,in the form of
76,to the united states
76,the value of the
76,a great deal of
76,to look at the
75,you dont want to
75,turned out to be
74,so one of the
74,a whole bunch of
73,with a lot of
72,was one of the
72,guest well i think
72,part of the problem
71,i dont think its
71,i think there is
71,had a lot of
71,a lot of these
71,i dont know what
71,and as a result
70,they are not going
70,but i think its
70,want to talk about
70,you are not going
70,i think this is
69,i just want to
69,to make sure that
69,but i dont think
69,is not going to
68,and so i think
68,in the book is
67,thats one of the
67,lets talk about the
67,of the people who
66,of the things i
66,if you think about
65,that would be a
64,a lot of what
64,spend a lot of
64,in the short run
64,the nature of the
64,the road to serfdom
63,so i think that
63,the united states in
63,is that if you
63,going to have a
63,i think that the
63,people are going to
63,on the one hand
63,has to do with
62,if you are going
62,its not going to
62,most of the time
62,there are people who
61,i think you are
61,it turns out that
61,what do you mean
61,as a result of
60,to come up with
60,that one of the
60,going to be the
60,skin in the game
60,of the 20th century
60,going to be able
59,too big to fail
59,have to worry about
59,when it comes to
59,were not going to
59,what they are doing
59,you have to be
59,a lot of them
59,it would have been
58,are going to do
58,i think one of
58,they dont want to
58,you have to have
58,and i dont think
58,think of it as
58,russ lets talk about
57,a lot of it
57,it would be a
57,that i think is
57,and so on and
57,for a lot of
57,do you want to
57,make a lot of
57,the middle of the
57,i think theres a
56,theres going to be
56,i agree with that
56,russ i want to
56,in the first place
56,thats part of the
56,but i think the
56,part of it is
56,think one of the
55,not going to get
55,i dont think it
55,let me give you
55,i think thats the
55,who is going to
55,not a lot of
55,going to talk about
55,be able to do
55,the fact that they
55,if you go back
54,to come back to
54,at the u of
54,i think we are
54,is a little bit
54,in the long run
54,that if you are
54,i dont think that
54,i have to say
53,that you have to
53,theory of moral sentiments
53,have to have a
53,you go back to
53,you have to do
53,we dont have a
53,a little bit about
52,you are looking at
52,so if you are
52,those of us who
52,turns out to be
52,going on in the
52,to figure out how
52,the beginning of the
52,i want to start
52,dont want to be
51,but at the same
51,what are some of
51,it used to be
51,there are lots of
51,are some of the
51,but one of the
51,at the beginning of
51,on the part of
51,its very hard to
51,the problem is that
51,is that there is
50,whats going on in
50,lot of people who
50,seems to me that
50,the other side of
50,and by the way
50,think there is a
50,weve been talking about
50,the fact that we
50,so i think the
49,do you think we
49,trying to figure out
49,the wealth of nations
49,to a lot of
49,i dont think we
49,to get out of
49,one of the great
49,to talk about the
49,to get rid of
49,come up with a
49,in the same way
49,a little bit more
48,to think about the
48,the way in which
48,in the face of
48,or something like that
48,to figure out what
48,not be able to
48,when we talk about
48,of the great depression
48,in a world where
48,all over the world
47,that they are not
47,end of the day
47,when you talk about
47,i dont know how
47,the number of people
47,were going to be
47,are more likely to
47,i think they are
47,when you think about
47,but there is a
46,but they are not
46,do you think the
46,let me ask you
46,you have to pay
46,this is one of
46,that are going to
46,figure out how to
46,and things like that
46,i dont think thats
46,you point out in
45,turn out to be
45,was going to be
45,to the extent that
45,they are trying to
45,i think it is
45,a couple of years
45,was a lot of
45,to the rest of
45,thats going to be
45,why do you think
45,of people who are
44,it has to be
44,for the most part
44,they were going to
44,the last 30 years
44,but i think that
44,the best way to
44,i dont have to
44,point out in the
44,we dont know how
44,people who want to
44,its not just that
44,i dont think you
44,have to look at
44,the case of the
44,what you are saying
44,a lot of other
43,get a lot of
43,why is it that
43,lets go back to
43,are we going to
43,you think about it
43,we are trying to
43,to take advantage of
43,a lot of times
43,the last 20 years
43,i want to talk
43,of the federal reserve
42,so i want to
42,over the course of
42,you dont have a
42,going to be very
42,to do is to
42,to the point where
42,is part of the
42,are talking about the
42,want to start with
42,dont know how to
42,a bit of a
42,you want to do
42,we dont want to
42,get rid of the
42,what was going on
42,the right way to
42,if there is a
42,going back to the
42,this is going to
41,on the basis of
41,in the book that
41,i want you to
41,we have to do
41,i think that is
41,if you are not
41,and if you are
41,and im going to
41,do a lot of
41,in the 19th century
41,you think about the
41,there was a lot
41,going to get a
41,we dont have to
41,cents on the dollar
41,if you are in
41,the rest of us
40,when you have a
40,once in a while
40,talk about some of
40,you are in a
40,is that there are
40,parts of the world
40,but i think it
40,have to do is
40,the united states has
40,guest yeah i think
40,are going to go
40,and it turns out
40,come back to that
40,the theory of moral
40,be a lot of
40,i want to make
40,not going to have
39,but if you are
39,a certain amount of
39,way to do it
39,dont know what the
39,to try to get
39,i think is a
39,is that they are
39,i think if you
39,so you have to
39,want to live in
39,out in the book
39,to be in the
39,in the united kingdom
39,over and over again
39,has a lot of
39,and you have to
39,that we are going
39,in the absence of
39,we are not going
39,there would be a
39,we need to do
38,what are your thoughts
38,has nothing to do
38,the power of the
38,one of the problems
38,a big fan of
38,if you dont have
38,of a lot of
38,in the sense of
38,to get back to
38,i think most people
38,to go to the
38,the rule of law
37,a bunch of people
37,a few years ago
37,we have a lot
37,i was going to
37,and there is a
37,whats going to happen
37,of the fact that
37,one of the big
37,the united states we
37,are going to make
37,there will be a
37,a lot of that
37,its a little bit
37,the book is that
37,about in the book
36,what we are talking
36,that there was a
36,no such thing as
36,if you think of
36,as a way to
36,if you wanted to
36,are you going to
36,part of the story
36,the rules of the
36,agree with you that
36,and i think this
36,what you are doing
36,got a lot of
36,in order to get
36,i want to go
36,to get to the
36,that would be the
36,the fact that there
36,a lot of different
36,about some of the
36,and as you point
36,go out of business
36,to do with it
36,and i think we
36,do you think that
36,going to give you
35,i want to come
35,in the way that
35,a large number of
35,there are so many
35,have to think about
35,do you think of
35,as far as i
35,they dont have to
35,and i dont know
35,and i think it
35,we look at the
35,you are in the
35,do you mean by
35,and they are not
35,i think in the
35,a huge amount of
35,here in the united
35,its one of the
34,lender of last resort
34,i want to ask
34,that the people who
34,one of my favorite
34,the federal funds rate
34,be able to get
34,and of course the
34,and the answer is
34,that the united states
34,little bit of a
34,that is going to
34,one of them is
34,how do we get
34,a lot of this
34,have to do with
34,that you are going
34,in the context of
34,and i think you
34,you talk about the
34,they were able to
34,i think its important
34,dont have to worry
34,i want to get
34,the great depression and
34,of the things you
34,and the fact that
33,to be a little
33,and so forth and
33,in the old days
33,100 cents on the
33,i think it would
33,that it would be
33,lets move on to
33,are a number of
33,what you mean by
33,it could be that
33,there are going to
33,rules of the game
33,of whats going on
33,about the role of
33,what is going on
33,we ought to be
33,think it would be
33,know how to do
33,you want to say
33,to get people to
33,you have a lot
33,in the last few
33,of the things we
33,russ so let me
33,by the end of
33,i dont think they
33,the kind of thing
33,what does that mean
33,find a way to
33,at the expense of
32,well come back to
32,going to try to
32,to take care of
32,the fact that you
32,we dont have the
32,the united states the
32,is that when you
32,to be a lot
32,been a lot of
32,but the point is
32,to do that and
32,want to look at
32,in the real world
32,in a different way
32,in the money supply
32,because they are not
32,when i think about
32,are trying to do
32,the point is that
32,are your thoughts on
32,i think part of
32,talk about in the
32,in the great depression
32,long period of time
32,a couple of things
32,in the aftermath of
32,in the 1980s and
32,you are suggesting that
32,the extent to which
32,do you think is
32,a lot more than
32,all kinds of things
31,but if you look
31,other side of the
31,use of knowledge in
31,and you are going
31,something to do with
31,of the book is
31,i think its very
31,is that a lot
31,that its hard to
31,want to make sure
31,it seems to be
31,want to have a
31,is going to get
31,every once in a
31,at a time when
31,and were going to
31,so i think thats
31,with the fact that
31,what i think is
31,we dont know what
31,by the fact that
31,the last few years
31,our topic for today
31,you want to get
31,for the united states
31,this is not a
31,the u of chicago
31,be a little bit
31,going to be an
31,to be on the
31,an enormous amount of
31,who are going to
30,the question is how
30,thats the kind of
30,guest i think thats
30,to pay for it
30,want to come back
30,to the fact that
30,a lot of work
30,the cost of the
30,made a lot of
30,want to ask you
30,i do think that
30,so there is a
30,have an incentive to
30,the way the world
30,doesnt have to be
30,which is a very
30,would be able to
30,we were talking about
30,for the rest of
30,that there is no
30,what do we know
30,the idea that the
30,people who are not
30,and there are a
30,going to be in
30,and the people who
30,lets start with the
30,that i dont think
30,want to go back
30,a point in time
30,but on the other
30,but i do think
30,there has been a
30,that it was a
30,for the first time
29,but as you point
29,i think we have
29,you want to have
29,in the 1970s and
29,the question is what
29,the united states that
29,intro recording date may
29,when we look at
29,a lot of those
29,so lets talk about
29,the 1980s and 1990s
29,i think is the
29,in terms of how
29,to some of the
29,seems to be a
29,so on and so
29,topic for today is
29,there are a number
29,so im going to
29,that this is a
29,so the question is
29,that we have to
29,the fact that people
29,you want to be
29,in terms of what
29,i think its not
29,so i think its
29,and thats going to
29,one of the challenges
29,if we look at
29,i look at the
29,they are the ones
29,that we are not
29,have to pay for
29,not going to do
29,that there would be
29,are a couple of
28,a big part of
28,and so on but
28,the last 50 years
28,all sorts of things
28,going to get the
28,what i want to
28,it and i think
28,so a lot of
28,there were a lot
28,i am going to
28,this is something that
28,its kind of a
28,a lot of evidence
28,to deal with the
28,the quality of the
28,in the book and
28,were a lot of
28,were going to talk
28,the head of the
28,our standard of living
28,were going to have
28,as long as you
28,the problem with that
28,is a good thing
28,from time to time
28,i think thats right
28,id like to see
28,of the 19th century
28,that we have a
28,and we are going
28,think its important to
28,way to say it
28,to pay for the
28,the same kind of
28,but in terms of
28,to think about what
28,and if you look
28,spent a lot of
28,going to make a
28,i think we should
28,have to go to
28,and some of the
28,you can think of
28,is that you are
28,that i want to
28,the united states but
28,its very difficult to
28,should be able to
27,you are saying that
27,i want to say
27,give you an example
27,of knowledge in society
27,in the hands of
27,at the time of
27,but it seems to
27,in the process of
27,that i think the
27,the united states are
27,the bank of england
27,the right thing to
27,but you have to
27,you can look at
27,the idea of the
27,so i think there
27,for a couple of
27,and it would be
27,that if you have
27,if we are going
27,and then you have
27,to do something about
27,there are a few
27,about the fact that
27,at least in the
27,some of them are
27,live in a world

26,the idea that you
26,there are a couple
26,it is true that
26,around the world and
26,a long time ago
26,russ well i think
26,when you are in

26,on top of that
26,in the private sector
26,im going to be
26,just look at the
26,i dont think there
26,but thats not the
26,is that we have
26,one of the first
26,at the time that
26,intro recording date july
26,that to the side
26,you were going to
26,at the top of
26,the new york times
26,lot of it is
26,the fact that its
26,that we dont have
26,in the book i
26,and some of them
26,do the same thing
26,of people in the
26,what would be the
26,i think thats what
26,by the way i
26,the vast majority of
26,i would like to
26,at a point in
26,but i think thats
26,in the history of
26,get out of the
26,the history of the
26,when you go to
26,we were going to
26,is that in the
26,would be a good
26,if you are an
26,the people who were
26,you want to call
26,of course there are
26,all the time and
26,to be a good
26,a year or two
26,guest thats right russ
26,what you want to
26,part of the book
26,to think about this
26,they are willing to
26,want to go to
26,lot of people are
26,i thought it was
25,on the order of
25,the united states was
25,that we need to
25,there is going to
25,to live in a
25,rest of the economy
25,number of people who
25,that they are going
25,we are looking at
25,of the world and
25,if you go to
25,at the time and
25,and i have to
25,a whole lot of
25,the part of the
25,i dont have any
25,have to do it
25,so i dont think
25,are the ones who
25,i think that was
25,you have to go
25,and what do you
25,a certain kind of
25,think theres a lot
25,and all of a
25,united states in the
25,is that correct guest
25,the affordable care act
25,and the united states
25,one way or another
25,other parts of the
25,the only way to
25,come back to the
25,and this is the
25,be a good thing
25,and so you have
25,the state of the
25,that you are not
25,in the way of
25,doesnt seem to be
25,in the future and
25,as well as the
25,but i think we
25,is the fact that
25,be one of the
25,and so on so
25,lot of people have
25,of the things thats
25,for the sake of
25,we think of as
25,that part of the
25,that seems to be
25,on a lot of
25,where do you think
24,anything to do with
24,are people who are
24,you look at what
24,is that it is
24,to do it and
24,in the rest of
24,from the fact that
24,take a look at
24,is that i think
24,for the government to
24,the idea that we
24,first of all i
24,intro recording date march
24,going to end up

24,the united states so
24,have been able to
24,an increase in the
24,if you take a
24,want to do is
24,that if you want
24,want to think about
24,and that would be
24,the savings and loan
24,because i think its
24,government is going to
24,you look at a
24,in a couple of
24,but im going to

23,so this is a
23,because there is a
23,and its not just
23,just a matter of
23,and the rest of
23,that if you look
23,you have to get
23,a long period of
23,the 1960s and 1970s
23,a little bit and
23,you think of that
23,that some of the
23,if you were to
23,the way i think
23,lot of money and
23,if you take the
23,the last 10 years
23,what i would call
23,one of the themes
23,to solve the problem
23,will be able to
23,as opposed to the
23,you have to look
23,you end up with
23,was supposed to be
23,over the last 30
23,might be able to
23,a different kind of
23,to find a way
23,you can have a
23,a lot of political
23,it was going to

23,the way that the
23,to give you a
23,do we know about
23,and this is a
23,i would say that
23,always going to be
23,if you had a
23,it was in the
23,and they are going
23,not the same as
23,you look at it
23,have to be able
23,at the time was
23,dont know if its
23,you are interested in
23,the united states which
23,think it was a
23,intro recording date october
23,the late 19th century
23,so if you look
23,that was one of
23,in the world and
23,and i agree with
23,we want to be
23,the 1950s and 1960s
23,in the interest of
23,of what we are
23,talk a little bit
23,are going to come
23,when i was a
23,so we have to
23,to buy a house
23,some of the things
23,and part of the
23,you have to make
22,just want to mention
22,intro recording date december
22,at the state level
22,what that means is
22,and it was a
22,in the 1960s and
22,is not a good
22,lot of what we
22,by the way the
22,you are saying is
22,intro recording date november
22,in that kind of
22,the difference between the
22,in a situation where
22,thats not going to
22,talk about what you
22,you think of the
22,want to try to
22,there are two things
22,a lot of us
22,the division of labor
22,to make the case
22,the way it is
22,where a lot of
22,in and of itself
22,they dont have the
22,and the other is
22,if they are not
22,you can get a
22,a lot of stuff
22,most of the people
22,you wouldnt want to
22,russ i dont know
22,think you are right
22,the top of the
22,that has to be
22,as a matter of
22,in new york city
22,me ask you a
22,dont want to do
22,the role of the
22,if you were a
22,lot of people would
22,the time of the
22,how to do that
22,but it was a
22,about the value of
22,so we have a
22,a group of people
22,a lot more people
22,of the income distribution
22,then you have to
22,hundreds of millions of
22,how do you know
22,do the right thing
22,in the labor market
22,going to make it
22,people at the bottom
22,from the rest of
22,are talking about a
22,what i mean by
22,a lot of ways
22,i think some of
22,even if you are
22,so i think we
22,what would you do
22,is going to have
22,think we need to
22,but it turns out
22,where there is a
22,guest i think the
22,you go to the
22,russ yeah i think
22,even though they are
22,and i would say
22,a huge part of
22,it but i think
21,were going to get
21,from the perspective of
21,i think about it
21,what we are doing
21,because there is no
21,and you look at
21,to be part of
21,that you dont have
21,its not just a
21,in all kinds of
21,able to do that
21,people who are going
21,would have been a
21,intro recording date june
21,of the economy and
21,i think that would
21,is kind of a
21,what to do with
21,of the problems with
21,a small number of
21,the united states to
21,point of view of
21,so i think theres
21,of some of the
21,way to do that
21,with respect to the
21,the effect of the
21,first of all the
21,to be a very
21,the economy as a
21,this is the way
21,we were able to
21,the back of the
21,things that are not
21,quite a bit of
21,that its going to
21,have a lot more
21,guest i think its
21,is if you are
21,need to do is
21,in the last 20
21,in the late 1990s
21,i dont think so
21,have to be careful
21,and we have to
21,are going to take
21,used to be the
21,to talk about it
21,as much as they
21,what you are talking
21,want to say anything
21,wouldnt be able to
21,what we are going
21,think there are some
21,what we need to
21,one way to think
21,do we know anything
21,to me that the
21,so if you have
21,get there from here
21,is that we are
21,dont think its a
21,have nothing to do
21,russ do you think
21,know a lot of
21,what happened in the
21,what you do is
21,dont think there is
21,at the national level
21,i dont know i
21,think this is a
21,the people who have
21,that and i think
21,to get into the
21,it doesnt have to
21,intro recording date january
21,dont want to go
21,and the reason is
21,at the level of
21,going to come back
21,a lot of reasons
21,its not just the
21,a lot of uncertainty
21,for people who are
21,i dont have a
21,people in the world
21,of the labor market
21,the things that are
21,if we want to
21,you go to a
21,dont know if you
21,and i think a
21,it turned out that
21,take a lot of
21,a different set of
20,the only thing that
20,do a good job
20,up a little bit
20,think there are two
20,know what to do
20,you are worried about
20,now one of the
20,if there is no
20,way of thinking about
20,more complicated than that
20,there has to be
20,to make sure they
20,the problem is the
20,the united states russ
20,and its a very
20,to a large extent
20,a lot to do
20,the same time the
20,not going to work
20,are they going to
20,to be one of
20,are not allowed to
20,and i think there
20,want to do that
20,people dont want to
20,earned income tax credit
20,are going to talk
20,well i think the
20,think thats a good
20,we live in a
20,is the role of
20,but it could be
20,want to call it
20,the way it was
20,in prison or jail
20,think is going to
20,he was going to
20,things to say about
20,the last 5 years
20,we know how to
20,a friend of mine
20,think there are a
20,to do it but
20,thought it was a
20,it in terms of
20,but the problem is
20,how to do it
20,and at the same
20,of the financial sector
20,people who dont have
20,the end of his
20,we are able to
20,in the direction of
20,that we dont know
20,a lot of attention
20,a little bit like
20,there is no reason
20,the left and the
20,there are all these
20,the other part of
20,if i want to
20,the things that we
20,need to think about
20,there is a very
20,the aftermath of the
20,my view is that
20,because of the way
20,we know anything about
20,a way to get
20,a good way to
20,a lot of economists
20,still a lot of
20,im not sure i
20,making a lot of
20,dont have to do
20,mae and freddie mac
20,in a number of
20,of the things they
20,that there are many
20,and as you say
20,russ lets turn to
20,it may not be
20,and of course we
20,but there are a
20,you and i are
20,economy as a whole
20,going to make the
20,but most of the
20,federal deposit insurance corporation
20,intro recording date september
20,some of the other
20,have to deal with
20,you want to make
20,and theres a lot
20,guest thats right and
20,make the case that
20,but i dont know
20,a lot about the
20,might be a little
20,the bottom of the
20,in the book which
20,there are very few
19,you and i have
19,want to make a
19,of course is that
19,a long time to
19,think its a very
19,the amount of money
19,and so forth but
19,as part of the
19,by the way that
19,guest i dont know
19,a very long time
19,at the federal level
19,have the right to
19,and we need to
19,we have to have
19,of what we do
19,but im not sure
19,thats a lot of
19,state of the economy
19,that you need to
19,if they want to
19,of people who have
19,of the rest of
19,i would argue that
19,what you think is
19,is how do you
19,put a link up
19,that but i think
19,people at the top
19,that you and i
19,russ what do you
19,because they dont have
19,and you have a
19,we just have to
19,the united states its
19,you talk about in
19,if you try to
19,out to be a
19,the earned income tax
19,the 1970s and 1980s
19,intro recording date april
19,they are able to
19,there are some people
19,the constitution of liberty
19,the other thing is
19,thats a good thing
19,i think the reason
19,you really want to
19,a very good job
19,in a position to
19,put that to the
19,be a little more
19,have a hard time
19,is to try to
19,for a very long
19,how much of that
19,but you are not
19,history of the united
19,the wall street journal
19,a lot of problems
19,know what they are
19,russ i agree with
19,and look at the
19,of that is that
19,we need to have
19,there is a certain
19,to talk about that
19,in the last 10
19,it in a way
19,you are not a
19,to make a lot
19,i think we can
19,when we think about
19,a little bit in
19,russ our topic for
19,the question is why
19,is a sort of
19,is a way of
19,of the kind of
19,to do with that
19,is a kind of
19,that i dont know
19,its hard to know
19,to think about that
19,what im saying is
19,are just going to
19,a way to make
19,just a little bit
19,a fair amount of
19,and all of that
19,you are willing to
19,to look at it
19,which is that the
19,a little more complicated
19,part of that is
19,they have a lot
19,to go through the
19,and then in the
19,do you think it
19,so theres a lot
19,the most important thing
19,the people in the
19,you are on the
19,its not the same
19,the same amount of
19,you cant do that
19,to do in the
19,to pay attention to
19,on both sides of
19,you can do it
19,a link up to
19,left and the right
18,the point of view
18,so if you think
18,are going to run
18,if you have an
18,out of the labor
18,in terms of their
18,but i think you
18,which is that you
18,and its going to
18,that they want to
18,would have to be
18,do we want to
18,one of the main
18,you want to go
18,there is not a
18,and thats one of
18,and then the other
18,by the way is
18,the rise of the
18,the quality of life
18,the last 25 years
18,are not in the
18,its not clear that
18,they dont have a
18,you need to have
18,was going to say
18,goes back to the
18,are going to see
18,i dont know whether
18,try to figure out
18,way of looking at
18,the way they are
18,of billions of dollars
18,it was a very
18,but the fact is
18,i think its an
18,the source of the
18,in this kind of
18,the answer to that
18,to people who are
18,the use of knowledge
18,the united states had
18,i think thats true
18,in the late 1970s
18,that there is an
18,in the book but
18,by the federal reserve
18,long term capital management
18,want it to be
18,to do a lot
18,to go to a
18,think that would be
18,out not to be
18,of the financial crisis
18,on the fact that
18,done a lot of
18,like a lot of
18,on the gold standard
18,going to look like
18,and the question is
18,the size of government
18,they seem to be
18,if i remember correctly
18,and this is what
18,he had a lot
18,is the kind of
18,but there are other
18,i think the problem
18,you get to the
18,than they used to
18,the book which is
18,the course of the
18,in the short term
18,it may be that
18,one of the key
18,so in that sense
18,in the wake of
18,have to pay a
18,i want to mention
18,what happens is the
18,what does it mean
18,lots and lots of
18,come back to this
18,hundreds of thousands of
18,a long time and
18,and you are not
18,i think we need
18,i think its the
18,a couple of times
18,it reminds me of
18,state and local governments
18,to go back and
18,despite the fact that
18,which is a little
18,russ were going to
18,think thats a very
18,to get access to
18,so what do you
18,a variety of reasons
18,i think is very
18,in such a way
18,a couple of weeks
18,we go back to
18,all of these things
18,your thoughts on that
18,the impact of the
18,there have been a
18,that you have a
18,a part of the
18,that the federal government
18,they have to be
18,you know you are
18,lets look at the
18,and you want to
18,how it is that
18,what do we do
18,in the world that
18,more and more people
18,the house and the
18,know a lot about
18,the money supply and
18,a lot more money
18,to keep in mind
18,you were talking about
18,and i think what
18,for a while and
18,going to do this
18,the first part of
18,it turns out to
17,are the people who
17,well i dont know
17,and how do you
17,the idea is that
17,is that its not
17,than they otherwise would
17,as one of the
17,the price of the
17,but its not a
17,in favor of the
17,in a world of
17,going on at the
17,and if you have
17,there would be no
17,a lot of our
17,dont want to say
17,think of them as
17,but its not the
17,theres no such thing
17,on the left and
17,to the end of
17,i think what we
17,well i think that
17,i think thats an
17,do you think about
17,to be the case
17,doing a lot of
17,the united states if
17,the case that the
17,the reason is that
17,its a question of
17,get back to the
17,going to lead to
17,but we dont have
17,me give you a
17,its one thing to
17,you dont have the
17,it would be great
17,make sure that the
17,that there is some
17,the rate of growth
17,have a very good
17,for those of you
17,to have a lot
17,have to do that
17,kind of thing that
17,of money and credit
17,im going to have
17,that kind of thing
17,in some of the
17,the sense that they
17,they are in the
17,they are doing is
17,look at the world
17,of the wealth of
17,id like you to
17,what would happen if
17,figure out what the
17,they have to do
17,the costs and benefits
17,of what they are
17,and most of the
17,thats a good point
17,take advantage of the
17,of millions of dollars
17,to the great depression
17,seems like a good
17,all of those things
17,there was a big
17,paying interest on reserves
17,in the course of
17,lot of people think
17,the question is whether
17,in the financial sector
17,in front of a
17,the benefit of the
17,the fact that i
17,the fact that a
17,you dont need to
17,a better way to
17,the book is the
17,for the people who
17,but in the end
17,standard of living is
17,when i look at
17,secretary of the treasury
17,guest i think it
17,do you have to
17,the financial crisis and
17,were talking about the
17,in the midst of
17,is i think a
17,do you think its
17,what would have happened
17,it was supposed to
17,if you are looking
17,it comes down to
17,tend to think of
17,and i think in
17,out a lot of
17,of the banking system
17,are not the same
17,be willing to pay
17,figured out how to
17,people around the world
17,as a kind of
17,and you talk about
17,think about it in
17,would be a lot
17,its not so much
17,im not sure thats
17,as if they are
17,both sides of the
17,which is going to
17,lot of people in
17,group of people who
17,a lot of bad
17,dont have a lot
17,it would be nice
17,the united states i
17,whats going on and
17,are the ones that
17,which is what we
17,but the people who
17,i like to think
17,and i dont want
17,the president of the
17,a bunch of stuff
17,dont want to have
17,make the world a
17,and it will be
17,to point out that
17,dont know how much
17,it goes back to
17,and then you get
17,and so as a
17,over the last 50
17,point i want to
17,in the 20th century
17,the extent of the
17,is there is a
17,in front of the
17,year and a half
17,im not sure that
17,going to do with
17,trying to do is
17,had nothing to do
17,but it would be
17,you can go to
17,you have to take
17,lot to do with
17,are talking about is
17,you are thinking about
17,is the idea that
17,guest well first of
17,in the stock market
17,as long as they
17,of these things are
17,the person who is
17,when you are talking
17,how did you get
17,to be in a
17,and thats what i
17,of things that are
17,in the economy and
17,probably not going to
17,well one of the
17,there is no way
17,out there in the
17,when i was in
17,i think he was
17,or whatever it is
16,and the problem is
16,come up with the
16,for the fact that
16,savings and loan crisis
16,im not so sure
16,why do we have
16,fact that they are
16,you need to do
16,the fact that it
16,so i dont know
16,i dont disagree with
16,monetary history of the
16,so i do think
16,could be that the
16,think part of the
16,to get to a
16,we need to get
16,have skin in the
16,are willing to pay
16,its very easy to
16,thing to do is
16,you have a very
16,from the point of
16,about a lot of
16,won the nobel prize
16,are worried about the
16,if you have to
16,and it seems to
16,but its hard to
16,the same is true
16,of the gold standard
16,a lot of their
16,a wide range of
16,going to go to
16,to the idea that
16,i dont see the
16,think thats part of
16,be able to make
16,thing i want to
16,want to make the
16,tens of thousands of
16,the last couple of
16,over the last few
16,early part of the
16,are going to find
16,about the united states
16,are supposed to be
16,russ one of the
16,you to talk about
16,one of the issues
16,it could be a
16,of the reasons that
16,if you dont do
16,but the question is
16,have the ability to
16,they are not the
16,and the role of
16,but if you want
16,a lot in the
16,far as i can
16,the growth of the
16,in the number of
16,and in fact the
16,i want to do
16,to do the right
16,are a little bit
16,you want to talk
16,and i think they
16,and there was a
16,russ fair enough guest
16,think we are going
16,do something about it
16,you come up with
16,very different from the
16,one of the biggest
16,to pay it back
16,you think is going
16,enough to go around
16,seems to be the
16,big part of the
16,and im not going
16,in the world of
16,to do that is
16,at the center of
16,in the right direction
16,its a good idea
16,you would have to
16,and that was a
16,to say it is
16,a change in the
16,i think the answer
16,and you dont have
16,one thing to say
16,you have to keep
16,the united states you
16,what to do about
16,they tend to be
16,it was not a
16,and the way that
16,in the early 1990s
16,going to get into
16,lets turn to the
16,so it was a
16,the interest of the
16,that there are a
16,i think the other
16,with that is that
16,have a little bit
16,the things that you
16,that this was a
16,problem with that is
16,so what happens is
16,lot of things that
16,that i think are
16,and the idea that
16,i think what you
16,one of the few
16,i dont know the
16,the same way that
16,dont know if thats
16,i was talking about
16,come out of the
16,thats the way it
16,russ yeah i agree
16,i would say the
16,division of labor is
16,to spend a lot
16,intro recording date august
16,we dont really know
16,he was trying to
16,think in terms of
16,in the business of
16,the united states because
16,about the nature of
16,have to make sure
16,and we have a
16,is that we dont
16,to that in a
16,thats not the way
16,20 or 30 years
16,if im going to
16,can come up with
16,in the value of
16,this in the book
16,end of his life
16,to deal with it
16,about it i think
16,have a sense of
16,had to do with
16,is one of those
16,on the edge of
16,the time it was
16,lets talk about that
16,at the heart of
16,the current state of
16,right now in the
16,in the way we
16,talk about this in
16,have to find a
16,how much of the
16,during the great depression
16,want to be a
16,you have to ask
16,the interests of the
16,but the idea that
16,you dont know what
16,it in the book
16,and that was the
16,bunch of people who
16,do it in a
16,in the fall of
16,think we have a
15,is going to go
15,to worry about the
15,the united states today
15,and there would be
15,and that is the
15,going to have an
15,just not going to
15,the one hand and
15,but thats not what
15,theres a lot more
15,guest i dont think
15,that sort of thing
15,the behavior of the
15,and then there are
15,but the fact that
15,lot of time on
15,that in order to
15,troubled asset relief program
15,i think you said
15,much more likely to
15,the second thing is
15,you think we are
15,do a lot better
15,over the last 20
15,because they want to
15,a number of people
15,so talk about that
15,the right kind of
15,the idea that there
15,at any point in
15,in the last 30
15,at the time but
15,but there is no
15,know the answer to
15,to the people who
15,russ im going to
15,that were going to
15,what you need to
15,to have to be
15,im going to get
15,but if you dont
15,an awful lot of
15,its part of the
15,and it turned out
15,is to look at
15,going to turn out
15,as long as the
15,that they dont have
15,of the themes of
15,willing to pay for
15,not a very good
15,the story of the
15,just a question of
15,the united states they
15,think they are going
15,of the 18th century
15,of goods and services
15,of economics is to
15,that turned out to
15,to find ways to
15,the fact that he
15,are going to say
15,do you have a
15,a lot of good
15,the world would be
15,that we are talking
15,would seem to be
15,house and the senate
15,are a bunch of
15,so first of all
15,because you dont have
15,all the way to
15,they didnt have to
15,that when you have
15,the same time i
15,may or may not
15,to have to make
15,to make it more
15,you are absolutely right
15,russ and i think
15,in the book you
15,but we are not
15,and then we have
15,for a number of
15,i was trying to
15,the way that we
15,and i think one
15,its hard to understand
15,but its not just
15,is going to make
15,im going to read
15,the rate at which
15,there would have been
15,coming out of the
15,is an example of
15,we talk about the
15,the average level of
15,so there are a
15,that there are some
15,in the price of
15,one of the arguments
15,hundreds of billions of
15,of the challenges of
15,you think you are
15,to ask you about
15,would be a very
15,not part of the
15,so you are going
15,have to figure out
15,is not the same
15,if it turns out
15,want to get into
15,my guess is that
15,it had to be
15,and then you can
15,seem to be a
15,me give you an
15,put it in the
15,want to be able
15,we dont need to
15,and its not a
15,it has to do
15,they are not in
15,the financial sector and
15,like the united states
15,is going to take
15,some of the same
15,the way we are
15,as a share of
15,we have in the
15,a lot of sense
15,i tend to think
15,you want to know
15,is a lot more
15,know whats going on
15,in the early 1980s
15,think about it is
15,want to know what
15,and in terms of
15,london school of economics
15,but i think there
15,the collapse of the
15,than it used to
15,but that doesnt mean
15,is going to change
15,people on the other
15,and you can see
15,i think theres some
15,going to take a
15,in the area of
15,about in terms of
15,of being able to
15,about that i think
15,because one of the
15,couple of years ago
15,to deal with that
15,the same time and
15,be part of the
15,way to look at
15,im sure there are
15,little bit about the
15,chair of the fed
15,are going to lose
15,so talk about what
15,and then of course
15,hard for people to
15,think of as the
15,the early part of
15,you want to see
15,makes a lot of
15,i do think there
15,its a good thing
15,a little bit better
15,there are all kinds
15,at the time i
15,to do that but
15,loose vague and indeterminate
15,of what you are
15,a result of the
15,the reason for that
15,i dont know that
15,are all kinds of
15,of the nature of
15,the total amount of
15,30 or 40 years
15,i certainly agree with
15,to come in and
15,you want to look
15,and of course they
15,if you are trying
15,have no idea what
15,imagine they can design
15,i think most of
15,we have to make
15,is due to the
15,that the federal reserve
15,and you get a
15,with other peoples money
15,as opposed to a
15,its very important to
15,fact that there are
15,and if you dont
15,of the value of
15,and when you look
15,i think you have
15,because they are going
15,a year from now
15,wrote a book called
15,in the world but
15,a lender of last
15,how do you think
15,large number of people
15,is going to work
15,one of which is
15,they used to be
15,to a bunch of
15,were going to make
15,i think there was
15,the idea of a
15,the ones that are
15,get a little bit
15,used to be that
15,the things that i
15,have to say that
15,so as a result
15,so when you look
15,the author of the
15,that a little bit
14,in order to make
14,end of the book
14,we really want to
14,the name of the
14,is a very important
14,in the journal of
14,be able to pay
14,gross domestic product gdp
14,what i think the
14,to make sure you
14,on the side of
14,not going to give
14,the price of oil
14,think of as a
14,the hands of the
14,theres no doubt about
14,want to make it
14,in the top 1
14,i think you can
14,way in which we
14,some kind of a
14,and to some extent
14,about the importance of
14,but the reality is
14,do i want to
14,is a little more
14,the middle of a
14,of the things he
14,lot of them are
14,nature of the firm
14,about it in the
14,we do have a
14,that needs to be
14,russ i think its
14,whats going on there
14,i dont know guest
14,out a way to
14,is no doubt that
14,im saying is that
14,you talk about this
14,does seem to be
14,it is going to
14,i think that we
14,and they want to
14,there is no doubt
14,there is a big
14,well i think its
14,but there was a
14,the united states it
14,to focus on the
14,the role of government
14,that many of the
14,the problem i have
14,so long as you
14,in favor of it
14,to say that the
14,that this is the
14,and so when you
14,about the great depression
14,would have had to
14,your reaction to that
14,your point is that
14,you could have a
14,and of course it
14,the public school system
14,russ yeah i dont
14,russ a lot of
14,thats a little bit
14,about what they imagine
14,to do that because
14,not all of it
14,in many of these
14,so you want to
14,hard for me to
14,and so if you
14,are never going to
14,im a big fan
14,the supply and demand
14,all kinds of ways
14,put a lot of
14,you think about that
14,i think thats part
14,any point in time
14,other things going on
14,want to get to
14,you are right that
14,the rest of it
14,are going to pay
14,was a good idea
14,the bush tax cuts
14,dont know much about
14,what you can do
14,it seems like a
14,to do it in
14,you have to say
14,in a little bit
14,the heart of the
14,a world where the
14,out to be the
14,one of the other
14,the question is is
14,in a minute but
14,take care of the
14,are part of the
14,was that if you
14,extent of the market
14,the other thing that
14,as a result the
14,supposed to be a
14,and then there is
14,i talk about in
14,the people who work
14,the economic way of
14,im talking about the
14,all the rest of
14,it a lot of
14,going to do something
14,gdp gross domestic product
14,and then youve got
14,i can tell you
14,they are talking about
14,the people at the
14,seems to me the
14,going to be there
14,in the book of
14,im going to go
14,the end of this
14,we havent talked about
14,and get rid of
14,in the late 1980s
14,we have a very
14,and we know that
14,a lot of jobs
14,on the idea that
14,that it is a
14,how to think about
14,that people want to
14,just in terms of
14,what we would call
14,to do the same
14,are all sorts of
14,a world in which
14,what you just said
14,of the economy is
14,this is what i
14,united states and the
14,doing the same thing
14,able to do it
14,to go to college
14,have anything to do
14,would like to see
14,because you have a
14,that i think that
14,think most people would
14,a couple of examples
14,a lot of places
14,what they imagine they
14,by the number of
14,what we think of
14,of that kind of
14,in order to do
14,the evidence for that
14,it i dont think
14,if i have a
14,a number of things
14,is that you have
14,is what we call
14,but they dont have
14,a big chunk of
14,and the reason i
14,which by the way
14,the united states guest
14,a good idea to
14,that we want to
14,i take your point
14,when you do that
14,the way to the
14,i think when you
14,you know if you
14,all the people who
14,that fannie and freddie
14,is not just a
14,right and i think
14,is very different from
14,and thats why i
14,lot of the time
14,but this is a
14,it was a good
14,the quantity of money
14,sense of the word
14,to talk about what
14,in the book the
14,the last 40 years
14,in other words the
14,some time in the
14,im not sure how
14,what happens in the
14,has to be a
14,because we dont have
14,much of it is
14,we get to the
14,kinds of things that
14,isnt going to be
14,what you have to
14,to be bailed out
14,a situation in which
14,go back to your
14,and other things that
14,dont have time to
14,be interesting to see
14,are really good at
14,of the power of
14,know how to make
14,the people on the
14,in terms of its
14,you dont have any
14,that we should be
14,how is it that
14,what they do is
14,you do is you
14,that there has been
14,a waste of time
14,its certainly true that
14,from the united states
14,as opposed to just
14,but if you have
14,for those of us
14,important part of the
14,a lot more of
14,and i think he
14,where there is no
14,all the things that
14,lost a lot of
14,so its not just
14,going to be much
14,that doesnt mean that
14,by a factor of
14,i want to close
14,in the world in
14,it is not a
14,little bit of the
14,which is kind of
14,even if you dont
14,the consumer price index
14,have to do something
14,doing a good job
14,in the early 2000s
14,and i dont have
14,just want to say
14,we can talk about
14,people are willing to
14,economic way of thinking
14,and i think theres
14,that we can do
14,i have no idea
14,i dont agree with
14,one of the ways
14,we do know that
14,on some of the
14,all you have to
14,may be able to
14,go the other way
14,is the one that
14,some of that is
14,but i think a
14,it depends on the
14,other things that are
14,so if you want
14,they want to be
14,that in terms of
14,what i call the
14,you go back and
14,the only way you
14,im sympathetic to that
14,all the way back
14,that i think its
14,one is going to
14,comes out of the
14,are going to use
14,for example if you
14,what happened was that
14,about it is that
14,which is one of
14,is to have a
14,are some people who
14,a lot of my
14,he didnt want to
14,and we dont have
14,if you are the
14,they imagine they can
14,that means is that
13,in the late 1920s
13,i think its going
13,its a matter of
13,so that would be
13,theres some truth to
13,i dont think i
13,out of high school
13,to think about how
13,the second half of
13,all kinds of other
13,task of economics is
13,doesnt work very well
13,a world where we
13,up a lot of
13,what we call the
13,take into account the
13,have that kind of
13,want to focus on
13,such a way that
13,going to do that
13,food and drug administration
13,and i think for
13,the first thing is
13,guest thats right so
13,of the world is
13,the united states as
13,but i think this
13,going to continue to
13,dont think you can
13,i think the best
13,there are many many
13,thats got to be
13,you need to be
13,say in the book
13,lets talk about some
13,some of them will
13,power of the state
13,you point out its
13,it doesnt seem to
13,an important part of
13,let me try to
13,lot of people argue
13,my point is that
13,you still have to
13,they can do it
13,a good thing to
13,can look at the
13,that they had to
13,want to do something
13,of course in the
13,a world where people
13,its sort of like
13,you point out that
13,want to say that
13,the congressional budget office
13,about the state of
13,not in favor of
13,there are all sorts
13,getting rid of the
13,its hard to imagine
13,by the extent of
13,the fed and the
13,who won the lottery
13,when people talk about
13,i think its true
13,things are going to
13,one of the lessons
13,to figure it out
13,dont have to have
13,russ so i want
13,part of it but
13,one part of the
13,enormous amount of money
13,the reason they are
13,you are doing is
13,its hard to measure
13,a member of the
13,so i think in
13,how much of it
13,you are allowed to
13,theres a lot to
13,along the lines of
13,that that would be
13,in response to the
13,some of the people
13,and they are very
13,because i want to
13,it doesnt matter what
13,most of them are
13,of the reason that
13,well be able to
13,it a different way
13,one way or the
13,to figure out the
13,by the way we
13,when you get to
13,people are worried about
13,is supposed to be
13,so that was a
13,the health of the
13,they would have been
13,think we have to
13,going to have the
13,would like to have
13,part of the economy
13,the other hand if
13,one or the other
13,are much more likely
13,as i can tell
13,thought it would be
13,i dont know why
13,i dont know who
13,came out of the
13,end of the year
13,who is in the
13,whats going on with
13,what can we do
13,the two of them
13,you are making a
13,this is where i
13,ought to be doing
13,think it is a
13,that because of the
13,way the world works
13,reminds me of the
13,was going on in
13,that is part of
13,you have to think
13,is very hard to
13,whole bunch of reasons
13,of the way the
13,that led to the
13,so that they can
13,the federal government is
13,whats your reaction to
13,need to worry about
13,is that most of
13,on the grounds that
13,weve been able to
13,a quarter of a
13,down a little bit
13,i think that that
13,first of all its
13,when you are looking
13,think we ought to
13,people in the united
13,do we have any
13,you try to do
13,that need to be
13,not going to happen
13,theres all kinds of
13,to the level of
13,have to recognize that
13,the end of that
13,talk a lot about
13,to take an example
13,they dont have any
13,to get the economy
13,fact that we are
13,a result of that
13,but i think in
13,so that you can
13,the business cycle and
13,if we think about
13,congressional budget office cbo
13,lot of evidence that
13,back and look at
13,they are kind of
13,a number of years
13,because if you are
13,to be much more
13,curious task of economics
13,whether or not you
13,the fact is that
13,are trying to figure
13,as it was in
13,you are kind of
13,not as much as
13,i want to take
13,more likely to get
13,but at the end
13,dont seem to be
13,a quarter of the
13,he is going to
13,to spend more money
13,but its a very
13,there might be a
13,to worry about that
13,they were trying to
13,that they didnt have
13,the same as the
13,we tend to think
13,what are you going
13,hard it is to
13,we are in the
13,guest right russ and
13,then the question is
13,the first thing that
13,the other is that
13,and i dont see
13,that was going to
13,that you are talking
13,whats your take on
13,to start a business
13,how hard it is
13,to solve that problem
13,youve got to have
13,dont have to go
13,think of themselves as
13,i think that there
13,do a better job
13,you want to give
13,who would like to
13,it all the time
13,now we have a
13,thats why i think
13,what is it that
13,the idea that they
13,and in some ways
13,that there was no
13,the last 15 years
13,in most of the
13,whats wrong with that
13,those are the two
13,i have to confess
13,out of the system
13,and thats why we
13,you agree with that
13,i think in some
13,might not be able
13,thats the way the
13,the other hand i
13,but the other thing
13,period of time and
13,to me is that
13,the london school of
13,we want to do
13,i would call the
13,a time when the
13,right way to think
13,there are a bunch
13,dont think we can
13,what goes on in
13,people who have been
13,asset relief program tarp
13,we dont have any
13,a little bit different
13,and a bunch of
13,you can argue that
13,a bunch of things
13,of the most important
13,and i think most
13,is to figure out
13,used to be a
13,if we were to
13,the curious task of
13,before we get to
13,they look at the
13,to move to the
13,as you say its
13,there is still a
13,you and i would
13,they are not very
13,me a little bit
13,that theres going to
13,of fannie and freddie
13,like a good thing
13,and so one of
13,may not be able
13,dont know anything about
13,in a way thats
13,x y and z
13,and we are not
13,of that in the
13,to me to be
13,because they dont want
13,2013 russ our topic
13,you get a lot
13,the whole idea of
13,what they are going
13,which is i think
13,going to work out
13,move on to the
13,is a form of
13,that if you were
13,dont think they are
13,the center of the
13,there is not enough
13,is what do you
13,these kinds of things
13,think that there is
13,by the time you
13,back a little bit
13,theres been a lot
13,dont know what they
13,as far as the
13,one of the interesting
13,and its hard to
13,for a whole bunch
13,they werent going to
13,we dont know the
13,because they have a
13,it is that you
13,the early 20th century
13,i think would be
13,but of course the
13,i know you are
13,in the late 19th
13,now a lot of
13,council of economic advisers
13,number of people in
13,i mean i think
13,that we have in
13,agree with that i
12,we have to look
12,one of the more
12,good for the economy
12,about what to do
12,i really want to
12,doesnt seem to have
12,to the question of
12,end up in the
12,i think that its
12,you want to think
12,that comes out of
12,a bunch of different
12,to do about it
12,think there is any
12,there seems to be
12,the world in the
12,are trying to make
12,two or three years
12,the best we can
12,well put a link
12,the private sector and
12,one of the best
12,the value of those
12,be a lot more
12,because you have to
12,to be the same
12,what happens is that
12,i dont see that
12,are trying to get
12,from the federal government
12,to get them to
12,in a certain way
12,it would have to
12,law legislation and liberty
12,i think the real
12,and so they are
12,of the reasons why
12,going to be more
12,are going to start
12,pay a lot of
12,is good for the
12,all around the world
12,and that is a
12,a lot of cases
12,what is the role
12,get a lot more
12,in charge of the
12,what kind of reaction
12,he was not a
12,know about what they
12,as soon as you
12,do you think they
12,he was one of
12,if you dont like
12,in the 18th century
12,for the average person
12,compete with each other
12,is to make sure
12,something like that and
12,they are not doing
12,its a very interesting
12,that there is this
12,a huge increase in
12,with you on that
12,of the reasons i
12,look at it and
12,you might want to
12,going to get to
12,say i want to
12,been going on for
12,that there will be
12,well i think thats
12,not going to go
12,going to be different
12,but part of it
12,a tremendous amount of
12,get rid of it
12,there are other things
12,mention in the book
12,there are people in
12,to men how little
12,are two things that
12,is that one of
12,way or the other
12,a high school degree
12,and what they are
12,that it was the
12,are talking about here
12,think that this is
12,to say we are
12,men how little they
12,is that people are
12,there are things that
12,i do think theres
12,and there will be
12,the mont pelerin society
12,in the soviet union
12,well i think it
12,dont know if they
12,do you think you
12,whats the big deal
12,i think of it
12,with each other and
12,its a lot of
12,it doesnt really matter
12,that is a very
12,in the modern world
12,when there is a
12,the sort of thing
12,i dont know but
12,the library of economics
12,out of business and
12,as much as you
12,think that was a
12,we really need to
12,to the 19th century
12,of millions of people
12,we didnt have a
12,of the number of
12,the value of their
12,i totally agree with
12,you are not in
12,that the private sector
12,to do things that
12,but at the time
12,a little more than
12,have been a lot
12,so there was a
12,i was struck by
12,was that it was
12,the people who do
12,the things that is
12,of the soviet union
12,value of the dollar
12,and we dont want
12,agree with you and
12,when the economy is
12,you dont do that
12,have a bunch of
12,the bottom line is
12,to do that i
12,are very good at
12,they are more likely
12,of money in the
12,so its a little
12,is the most important
12,we just talked about
12,were supposed to be
12,to be involved in
12,i think that it
12,if you are on
12,going to be hard
12,that there are these
12,was to try to
12,and as you said
12,they want to make
12,there has been an
12,in this particular case
12,you get to a
12,want to be in
12,im going to make
12,so when you say
12,think thats going to
12,would be willing to
12,of course they are
12,to believe that the
12,that you dont want
12,that some of these
12,some people who are
12,it is in the
12,different parts of the
12,what they were doing
12,that people who are
12,to be done and
12,a lot of interesting
12,rate of growth of
12,you can see that
12,the way we think
12,be able to have
12,that we are all
12,i dont think he
12,of looking at the
12,do in the book
12,to do it i
12,are not able to
12,going to come from
12,a lot of fun
12,if there was a
12,theres no question that
12,it you have to
12,what we want to
12,they are looking at
12,we would have had
12,some truth to that
12,is a way to
12,the supply of money
12,in fact if you
12,and if you want
12,in the developing world
12,not very good at
12,we dont have that
12,may not be the
12,if you do it
12,the first person to
12,that you can have
12,i think that you
12,not a matter of
12,the other way around
12,the essence of the
12,in one way or
12,guest on this program
12,one of the greatest
12,he was a very
12,to get a lot
12,of the us economy
12,to get to that
12,is part of it
12,its hard to do
12,at the other end
12,is going to come
12,know if you are
12,are we talking about
12,you do in the
12,that first of all
12,did not have a
12,so they have to
12,as you pointed out
12,we could talk about
12,how to make it
12,that you would have
12,a matter of time
12,does it mean to
12,they do is they
12,and get your reaction
12,dont think theres any
12,not much of a
12,the best thing to
12,and on the other
12,economic cooperation and development
12,of people who dont
12,of supply and demand
12,talk about that and
12,have to give up
12,to take into account
12,like the idea of
12,part of the 20th
12,that is that the
12,far as i know
12,its not a good
12,it will be a
12,to pay off the
12,what are they doing
12,in the runup to
12,a very small number
12,that i dont have
12,the wake of the
12,but when it comes
12,what it means to
12,that is not the
12,i think the way
12,is what is the
12,but i think what
12,at the time it
12,the ways in which
12,and i would argue
12,the united states a
12,i want to try
12,bureau of labor statistics
12,dont think we have
12,the cause of the
12,im going to do
12,in the early part
12,russ i think the
12,the federal deposit insurance
12,going to do the
12,im just going to
12,be in favor of
12,and then theres the
12,we talked about earlier
12,in other parts of
12,library of economics and
12,so in a way
12,it was a big
12,with the idea that
12,which i thought was
12,you are saying guest
12,of economics and liberty
12,thats a good question
12,in one of the
12,so it seems to
12,the united states were
12,yeah i think thats
12,the end of wwii
12,so in terms of
12,it needs to be
12,i think in a
12,are not in a
12,going to change the
12,like the idea that
12,in the past but
12,lets talk a little
12,that they have to
12,from the bottom up
12,it could be the
12,and so forth so
12,to do something that
12,in and out of
12,we dont do anything
12,to try to figure
12,are always going to
12,but you dont have
12,this is a good
12,but if you go
12,that there is something
12,i just dont think
12,and youve got to
12,to make the world
12,it is that the
12,no child left behind
12,what im talking about
12,very hard to get
12,might not be the
12,so much of the
12,its not obvious that
12,think you have to
12,and so we have
12,there could be a
12,you can do that
12,just going to be
12,i think its just
12,which is to say
12,come to an end
12,easier for people to
12,for a little bit
12,its a little more
12,lot of people say
12,i think is really
12,to put it in
12,the balance sheets of
12,be the case that
12,i mean by that
12,the best they can
12,we get there from
12,and of course its
12,if you believe that
12,it might not be
12,a kind of a
12,that is in the
12,and i wanted to
12,us out of the
12,so in other words
12,have to go back
12,there would be some
12,pretty much the same
12,the private sector is
12,one of the points
12,the second world war
12,if we had a
12,has something to do
12,a lot better than
12,was kind of a
12,i think people are
12,not a big fan
12,if you are doing
12,the other one is
12,happens all the time
12,in the early 1930s
12,id like to hear
12,limited by the extent
12,not going to pay
12,an immense amount of
12,way in which the
12,is going on in
12,guest right russ so
12,will be better off
12,the price of gold
12,but that would be
12,of it is that
12,the federal reserve and
12,of the sort of
12,and it has to
12,not obvious to me
12,to that i think
12,and im not sure
12,were going to come
12,at some point in
12,to do that so
11,and then we can
11,are you suggesting that
11,relative to the rest
11,you had to do
11,its not as if
11,of the problem is
11,if we go back
11,have been in the
11,it is that we
11,in the wrong direction
11,the market price is
11,so its not that
11,5 or 10 years
11,but it turned out
11,russ i think you
11,agree with that but
11,and id like to
11,and what you are
11,mac and fannie mae
11,and of course there
11,to do with a
11,i think that people
11,but part of the
11,they are not really
11,to look at this
11,so the fact that
11,increase in government spending
11,for a while but
11,dont know what to
11,whats going on is
11,the one thing that
11,looking at the world
11,very high rates of
11,out how to make
11,the same as it
11,its not really a
11,a number of different
11,a level playing field
11,are going to look
11,to think of the
11,at the local level
11,bruce bueno de mesquita
11,what we see is
11,if you had to
11,talk about that in
11,of some kind of
11,there were lots of
11,ask you a question
11,in fact it was
11,the value of a
11,as much as possible
11,the creation of the
11,about what you mean
11,they are interested in
11,of the role of
11,at the bottom of
11,problem i have with
11,that they have a
11,has to be done
11,the government is going
11,i want to give
11,they didnt want to
11,its not the only
11,i think its really
11,you are supposed to
11,who are trying to
11,a lot of countries
11,of that is the
11,over the long run
11,do not want to
11,to say about it
11,do we need to
11,the problems of the
11,long as you are
11,is i dont think
11,it was just a
11,want to come to
11,at the age of
11,the same thing as
11,not a good idea
11,a few months ago
11,to the size of
11,a long long time
11,dont have to pay
11,and i know that
11,but we want to
11,quite a lot of
11,the level of the
11,a great deal about
11,im going to put
11,a number of times
11,make a lot more
11,you see a lot
11,and so what we
11,that was a good
11,who are in the
11,we owe it to
11,about the future and
11,both in terms of
11,by the people who
11,russ for sure guest
11,we want them to
11,get their money back
11,no no no no
11,its a way of
11,then there was a
11,we have to get
11,you have to know
11,the question of whether
11,one of those things
11,theres got to be
11,so i think it
11,try to do it
11,and if you get
11,so youve got to
11,what we should do
11,freddie mac and fannie
11,are suggesting that the
11,we need to think
11,whole bunch of people
11,have a tendency to
11,that the price of
11,give a lot of
11,it has a lot
11,to live in the
11,so im not sure
11,that there are people
11,that we ought to
11,im going to try
11,and i have a
11,where you have a
11,we spend a lot
11,having said that i
11,of what we call
11,was going to happen
11,if you want a
11,is that you dont
11,want to close with
11,is kind of the
11,and this is an
11,agree with you i
11,fact that we have
11,thats going to make
11,that you can do
11,were going to go
11,could argue that the
11,people who dont like
11,a lot of trouble
11,does not mean that
11,so you dont have
11,i think thats one
11,how many people are
11,what we ought to
11,its hard to believe
11,about that for a
11,off the top of
11,so i dont want
11,in the 1990s and
11,the owner of the
11,the idea that people
11,way the world is
11,to do it is
11,most people would say
11,thats a great point
11,we talked about the
11,as a practical matter
11,to find a job
11,i would have to
11,but i think if
11,in the state of
11,going to run out
11,but if you think
11,me a lot of
11,look at the history
11,a good example of
11,is based on the
11,which is that its
11,think there was a
11,to do that you
11,have to have the
11,in the morning and
11,that when you are
11,on that guest well
11,a lot of great
11,a good thing guest
11,you are doing it
11,and then the third
11,you mean by the
11,i dont have the
11,what happens when you
11,to the kind of
11,if i had to
11,is the result of
11,of it is the
11,i think we could
11,doesnt work that way
11,i look forward to
11,there may be a
11,small group of people
11,but it is a
11,i think that if
11,talk in the book
11,its going to take
11,hard to believe that
11,as if it were
11,they are supposed to
11,in the financial crisis
11,to ask the question
11,is a much more
11,and so there is
11,take advantage of that
11,but we have to
11,problem of social cost
11,at some point the
11,just looking at the
11,i just have to
11,probably going to be
11,president of the united
11,because you are not
11,no doubt about it
11,yeah i think that
11,want to do it
11,to be fair to
11,to look at what
11,if we could just
11,that i think thats
11,guest it is a
11,of thousands of people
11,in the social sciences
11,there is such a
11,so what you are
11,to some extent the
11,when it came to
11,is always going to
11,and what are the
11,even if it were
11,and i think about
11,but it is not
11,get rid of all
11,going to come to
11,think its a good
11,the health care system
11,the people who had
11,was the result of
11,that would be true
11,guest but i think
11,we are dealing with
11,is limited by the
11,im in favor of
11,average level of prices
11,i think the right
11,there is very little
11,off the gold standard
11,how did we get
11,to find out what
11,is what i call
11,small number of people
11,of the private sector
11,a whole range of
11,the other thing i
11,of the way that
11,why it is that
11,thats what we are
11,have an impact on
11,want to get the
11,going on is that
11,it was one of
11,thats a good idea
11,one of the people
11,but we have a
11,i want to turn
11,you could do that
11,toward the end of
11,get out of it
11,in a certain sense
11,united states i think
11,if we have a
11,some of which are
11,and all kinds of
11,i think that this
11,and the reason they
11,and it is a
11,part of what we
11,of a sudden you
11,is some kind of
11,all over the place
11,its not that the
11,what you are trying
11,and we dont know
11,are willing to accept
11,come up with an
11,that weve talked about
11,and that sort of
11,we want to have
11,to do this and
11,i have to be
11,it back to the
11,a large part of
11,of the history of
11,would be a big
11,much more of a
11,when he was a
11,they are not as
11,youve got to be
11,at some of the
11,the other end of
11,there is a tendency
11,this is just a
11,is that this is
11,for a bunch of
11,the rest of your
11,going to be talking
11,you can think about
11,they are on the
11,the european central bank
11,to the point that
11,russ thats true guest
11,as a percentage of
11,have an effect on
11,that there was this
11,is what we are
11,for those who are
11,problem in the united
11,is that many of
11,lot of people dont
11,world would be a
11,that of course is
11,if you think that
11,well talk about that
11,a year and a
11,standard of living in
11,that i think we
11,last couple of years
11,dont think it was
11,not just in the
11,the united states there
11,in the last 5
11,im not sure its
11,have the incentive to
11,think the problem is
11,united states and in
11,and many of them
11,what happens to the
11,i looked at the
11,the ability of people
11,i was able to
11,what im trying to
11,read a lot of
11,one of the questions
11,a small group of
11,you point out there
11,want to have to
11,that would be one
11,i think the biggest
11,and if you think
11,there are times when
11,of the things about
11,a lot of very
11,the way it works
11,you need to know
11,that used to be
11,to do other things
11,if they dont have
11,and thats what the
11,a little hard to
11,need to look at
11,know what it is
11,we should be doing
11,there have been some
11,talk to each other
11,to each other and
11,the increase in the
11,lot of money but
11,and so you are
11,in fact i think
11,economics is to demonstrate
11,history of economic thought
11,that in the last
11,who are worried about
11,you are able to
11,agree with that guest
11,to start with the
11,we just dont know
11,russ and as you
11,to a certain extent
11,of one of the
11,guest thats exactly right
11,of people would say
11,make a distinction between
11,people like you and
11,are things that are
11,think about these things
11,a third of the
11,and thats part of
11,the united states by
11,the whole thing is
11,question is how much
11,that the best way
11,to look at a
11,going to use the
11,you can do is
11,make it easier for
11,the money supply is
11,of the people in
11,but thats the way
11,takes a long time
11,its really hard to
11,grew up in the
11,when i talk about
11,if you have more
11,them a lot of
11,into the banking system
11,see it as a
11,the best you can
11,so let me give
11,what is going to
11,im not sure what
11,is that its a
11,the kinds of things
11,talked about this before
11,people think they are
11,going to go back
11,to a world where
11,lets put that to
11,lot of money to
11,way to deal with
11,i think the main
11,i think thats not
11,an enormous number of
11,you talk about that
11,in the wealth of
11,will be a lot
11,if i were a
11,how did that happen
11,one of the examples
11,of people on the
11,look at the numbers
11,that in the short
11,to this kind of
11,person is going to
11,view of the world
11,do anything about it
11,or do you think
11,you dont get the
11,the changes in the
11,you want to buy
11,and why is it
11,100 years from now
11,very much in the
11,was part of the
11,think there will be
11,and they have a
11,going to be some
11,and at the end
11,be able to take
11,to tease out the
11,to the extent we
11,there may be some
11,be able to say
11,a lot of really
11,i used to be
11,i think the challenge
11,the equivalent of a
10,to make a difference
10,tens of millions of
10,increase in the money
10,was going to get
10,if you live in
10,dont think thats a
10,as much money as
10,the price of housing
10,for most of us
10,like you and me
10,you have some interesting
10,short period of time
10,not the same people
10,that has to do
10,as if it is
10,care a lot about
10,of course theres a
10,the outcome of the
10,a share of gdp
10,would you want to
10,people who were in
10,example in the book
10,owe it to ourselves
10,found a way to
10,supposed to be the
10,at the university of
10,in the theory of
10,guest yeah thats right
10,much of that is
10,and they are all
10,and the second thing
10,of that i think
10,that you think are
10,to do that we
10,the fact that if
10,that guest i think
10,the opposite of what
10,it at the time
10,you dont get a
10,the federal reserve system
10,people on the left
10,the way to go
10,first part of the
10,the monetary base and
10,talk about what the
10,no doubt about that
10,you may not be
10,if you dont believe
10,in the developed world
10,think you are going
10,way we think about
10,i think the key
10,at the individual level
10,be able to go
10,is that all of
10,its an empirical question
10,the fall of 2008
10,make as much money
10,the rate of inflation
10,of course if you
10,a lot of interest
10,trying to get the
10,is that a correct
10,in order to be
10,there are many people
10,the interesting thing is
10,but my point is
10,there are many other
10,of the interesting things
10,to start with a
10,look back at the
10,there are many ways
10,and so what you
10,in a way you
10,to do what they
10,that the only way
10,in front of me
10,dont you talk about
10,you can talk about
10,and the reason for
10,put it this way
10,not quite the same
10,would be in the
10,are going to end
10,do a lot more
10,that might be a
10,now you have to
10,to try to do
10,federal reserve bank of
10,really one of the
10,the cost of living
10,and that is that
10,things you can do
10,the average person is
10,the tragedy of the
10,labor is limited by
10,out what to do
10,you get rid of
10,dont know if this
10,you are more likely
10,guest i think there
10,if you didnt have
10,russ yeah guest and
10,those of you who
10,whether or not they
10,about the limits of
10,in a kind of
10,a lot of romance
10,of the world that
10,no matter how much
10,what we do is
10,with that i think
10,not just that they
10,and one of them
10,there are too many
10,things that are going
10,ability of people to
10,i want to just
10,think of this as
10,it does raise the
10,think that if you
10,if you read the
10,is that people who
10,what i would say
10,think the answer is
10,and at some point
10,russ i think thats
10,was a little bit
10,came up with a
10,of people argue that
10,things like that but
10,want to mention that
10,doing things that are
10,dont know what that
10,and there are some
10,and there is no
10,to pay a lot
10,the same number of
10,of it and the
10,if you look back
10,the federal reserve board
10,to do something and
10,thats what you are
10,you know i think
10,you take a look
10,the low interest rates
10,correct guest thats right
10,to say about the
10,your point about the
10,a piece of paper
10,them out of the
10,going to be really
10,and all the rest
10,needs to be done
10,dont want you to
10,the secretary of the
10,over a long period
10,theres no reason to
10,is not the only
10,might not be a
10,so its hard to
10,because there was a
10,because we have a
10,of it is just
10,do you think there
10,they would be able
10,united states has a
10,going to go out
10,your take on that
10,and if they are
10,its kind of like
10,is that a good
10,to go in and
10,with their own money
10,even if they are
10,of the state to
10,out and i think
10,we want to make
10,to have lots of
10,of the virtues of
10,as much as the
10,if we didnt have
10,in the us economy
10,russ what about the
10,if you get the
10,taxes are going to
10,to talk about a
10,think that they are
10,what do you have
10,make it harder to
10,like to see it
10,the cheapest way to
10,it doesnt matter how
10,you and you are
10,be a good idea
10,are the kind of
10,weve talked about the
10,are going to buy
10,lot of people will
10,in a way its
10,the velocity of money
10,really know about what
10,of this in the
10,the other hand it
10,but i just want
10,dont know if we
10,need to have a
10,you are part of
10,say we are going
10,is sort of a
10,were trying to do
10,bank of the united
10,the articles of confederation
10,the same thing in
10,as much as i
10,let me tell you
10,go back and look
10,come up with something
10,russ i just want
10,and said this is
10,a good thing or
10,a few of them
10,in the 1920s and
10,it because of the
10,to whether or not
10,that would be an
10,make sure that you
10,you have a system
10,a way in which
10,dont want them to
10,it turns out the
10,with the rest of
10,where they are going
10,large numbers of people
10,the great depression the
10,out some of the
10,amount of money and
10,have a lot to
10,want to turn to
10,the turn of the
10,have to be very
10,of labor is limited
10,in the fact that
10,not so much that
10,the answer is no
10,how much do you
10,pay attention to the
10,is the way i
10,there is also a
10,im a little bit
10,you can kind of
10,and a little bit
10,and why do you
10,going to go up
10,had a lot more
10,and we want to
10,im going to take
10,if we dont do
10,as if they were
10,is that if we
10,a conflict of interest
10,the last 3 years
10,certainly agree with you
10,in advance of the
10,to get it right
10,in the housing market
10,answer to that question
10,of time in the
10,to try to keep
10,and the way they
10,to do i think
10,it one of the
10,in the greek world
10,of the time we
10,or anything like that
10,on the verge of
10,are not the only
10,than we used to
10,people want to live
10,its going to have
10,a lot of cash
10,we are not talking
10,and the other thing
10,are going to vote
10,and then some of
10,we dont really understand
10,more important than the
10,they know how to
10,so its a very
10,is that its very
10,you dont get to
10,long as they are
10,why dont you talk
10,an example of how
10,of the housing market
10,i think it has
10,to have an impact
10,to come to the
10,have to take a
10,the case of a
10,there should be a
10,bang for the buck
10,what are we going
10,outside the united states
10,do in order to
10,thats what i think
10,and part of it
10,and then you say
10,i say in the
10,of the world we
10,to be careful about
10,the bureau of labor
10,consumer price index cpi
10,the fed is doing
10,not to say that
10,he talks about the
10,the second part of
10,to worry about it
10,the market will bear
10,the importance of the
10,then i want to
10,totally agree with you
10,what it is that
10,want to take a
10,had to be a
10,the board of governors
10,i could be wrong
10,if you talk to
10,so i dont have
10,it would be better
10,and that means that
10,what we have to
10,the international monetary fund
10,and i think if
10,on this program a
10,over the last 40
10,to think about is
10,the financial sector is
10,for people who dont
10,is a big problem
10,is the ability to
10,i think the question
10,to be very careful
10,its not surprising that
10,well get to that
10,what we can do
10,to have the same
10,know and dont know
10,that we have the
10,to make it work
10,when you think of
10,i hope we can
10,for the kind of
10,large sums of money
10,theres not a lot
10,no matter what the
10,and it can be
10,if its going to
10,do a little bit
10,the ones who are
10,to know how to
10,not being able to
10,increase in the number
10,the problem of social
10,i think on the
10,for quite a while
10,the world is a
10,that this is not
10,the extent that the
10,and the way we
10,of the most interesting
10,a lot of information
10,we can look at
10,of the bank of
10,that you could have
10,are very hard to
10,want to give you
10,dont want to get
10,are one of the
10,if there is an
10,then you have the
10,what they want and
10,of people who were
10,how are we going
10,like the fact that
10,in a way it
10,and i think as
10,is sort of the
10,that the fact that
10,to people in the
10,the book and i
10,are talking about in
10,rate of time preference
10,not doing very well
10,and we talked about
10,have to pay the
10,which is what the
10,you can see it
10,is the way it
10,what we should be
10,how important it is
10,that in a second
10,in the quality of
10,by the way when
10,it could be true
10,you have to give
10,what the fed is
10,chairman of the fed
10,with that kind of
10,is not very good
10,thing you can do
10,in the new york
10,we know a lot
10,if you are worried
10,i was talking to
10,i think the most
10,that we are in
10,russ yeah its a
10,which would be the
10,that i have a
10,can do a lot
10,we need to be
10,that i think you
10,about the stock market
10,such a thing as
10,is a matter of
10,if you dont know
10,people are trying to
10,and if you do
10,you just look at
10,is there are some
10,in the beginning of
10,and you are suggesting
10,a lot of changes
10,go out and buy
10,was going to do
10,the same way as
10,do that is to
10,just because of the
10,the fair trade movement
10,to talk about this
10,is something that is
10,in a second but
10,would argue that the
10,think about it and
10,let me ask a
10,i want to emphasize
10,in the early days
10,the united states or
10,the economy is doing
10,id like to get
10,we are about to
10,we know about the
10,so it is a
10,is to say that
10,that theres a lot
10,point out that the
10,this is not the
10,to happen in the
10,i go back to
10,you mention in the
10,argue in the book
10,the great depression was
10,how many of them
10,this is part of
10,what it is and
10,a lot more to
10,but you are saying
10,the banking system and
10,to make it clear
10,in which we are
10,and i do think
10,how to deal with
10,you do have to
10,going on with the
10,thats kind of a
10,then all of a
10,dont have the data
10,i would say is
10,in the world is
10,people want to buy
10,that the fed is
10,the face of the
10,makes it easier to
10,everywhere a monetary phenomenon
10,best way to do
10,would be great to
10,it to be a
10,at the high end
10,what have we learned
10,that to me is
10,i think the evidence
10,so i would say
10,we talk a lot
10,to do with this
10,seems to me to
10,is to demonstrate to
10,deposit insurance corporation fdic
10,in the wall street
10,size of the pie
10,end up with a
10,arent going to be
10,have to make a
10,you really have to
10,like to have a
10,the same thing with
10,to try to make
10,the troubled asset relief
10,make in the book
10,not a good thing
10,but lets talk about
10,are not talking about
10,it would be very
10,the last two years
10,not to be true
10,to move on to
10,which is what you
10,that could be a
10,such thing as a
10,will take care of
10,do you think are
10,what we call a
10,part of this is
10,kind of like the
10,dont know what it
10,most of us are
10,say the same thing
10,but we are going
10,would just be a
10,always and everywhere a
10,going to take the
10,what is meant by
10,it i think its
10,as much as we
10,up the price of
10,going to happen and
10,are looking at a
10,its going to happen
10,what the market will
10,so we need to
10,dont have to know
10,and if they dont
10,there is an incentive
10,turns out that the
10,on that i think
10,about the power of
10,lets go to the
10,in the book in
10,is that you can
10,are in the middle
10,lets talk about what
10,you are referring to
10,so you have this
10,to be talking about
10,sorts of things that
10,its not obvious to
10,supply and demand and
10,so this is the
10,and everywhere a monetary
10,back to the old
10,and you and i
10,why is it important
10,know what you are
10,in the early 1970s
10,russ so when you
10,theres no doubt that
10,in some sense the
10,a couple of different
10,this is where we
10,it i think the
10,we should try to
10,back to the 19th
10,some of them have
10,we talked about it
10,so you are saying
10,about it and i
10,the sense that the
10,and all the other
10,little more complicated than
10,is the nature of
10,some of those things
10,that we would be
10,the economy and the
10,you know what the
10,to be willing to
10,is because of the
10,other part of the
10,that its not a
10,so we are going
10,its a kind of
10,think that is the
10,there is a huge
10,to the idea of
10,the house of representatives
10,about what are the
10,the height of the
10,beginning of the book
10,number of people and
10,i want to move
10,guest i think we
10,going to look at
10,the united states would
10,its just a question
10,put it in a
10,a pretty good job
10,like to look at
10,have to rely on
10,you think they are
10,are not very good
10,think that there are
10,because of all the
10,are going to put
10,a couple of months
10,world we live in
10,you going to do
10,of course as you
10,if you looked at
10,of course there is
10,going to pay for
10,what we do in
9,the use of the
9,talked about in the
9,there was a time
9,get a sense of
9,and it may be
9,im going to ask
9,in the game and
9,is going to look
9,of the world but
9,of labor statistics bls
9,get a handle on
9,so that is a
9,me ask you about
9,and drug administration fda
9,there are more people
9,guest thats right the
9,are less likely to
9,have a chance to
9,many of them are
9,thats right i think
9,russ well i dont
9,to be more like
9,they may not be
9,it will be interesting
9,to get away from
9,it could have been
9,we dont know who
9,it is a little
9,of those things are
9,on the supply side
9,would be in a
9,and we ought to
9,a good thing that
9,on at the same
9,mean by that is
9,that im going to
9,the united states for
9,people who have the
9,in the spirit of
9,they were in the
9,to learn how to
9,than they would be
9,over the last 10
9,out to be true
9,and that seems to
9,what did you do
9,that that was a
9,little bit in the
9,you dont know if
9,the securities and exchange
9,i was a kid
9,its not that they
9,for the economy as
9,in terms of a
9,willing to pay more
9,been one of the
9,yeah i agree with
9,i have to do
9,what we might call
9,lot of uncertainty about
9,as it turns out
9,lot of attention to
9,when we are talking
9,about the size of
9,to be thinking about
9,they are the same
9,individualism and economic order
9,thats part of it
9,and then if you
9,are people in the
9,do you agree with
9,are really talking about
9,the way to do
9,to the labor market
9,how to get the
9,for economic cooperation and
9,a good thing but
9,would not have been
9,and thats something that
9,there are two ways
9,you want to take
9,to do that for
9,you actually look at
9,what are they going
9,if you just look
9,would be nice if
9,you are not careful
9,within the united states
9,on the table and
9,its hard to see
9,a fair number of
9,by the way guest
9,that the government should
9,all kinds of reasons
9,the harlem childrens zone
9,for that kind of
9,way a lot of
9,i would have thought
9,a high level of
9,we all know that
9,whats the evidence that
9,the result of a
9,not because of the
9,securities and exchange commission
9,we think about the
9,going on on the
9,to a point where
9,so there are many
9,guest so i think
9,in the political process
9,the other thought i
9,to run out of
9,and other kinds of
9,the economy is in
9,is going to say
9,way to think of
9,was a guest on
9,youll be able to
9,link up to it
9,me one of the
9,do we get there
9,and this is not
9,you dont know the
9,youve got to do
9,as well in the
9,which is what i
9,maybe a little more
9,thats a very good
9,on top of it
9,it guest i think
9,guest thats right i
9,if you are really
9,a society in which
9,if you go and
9,take a long time
9,well i dont think
9,well lets talk about
9,a little bit on
9,i was thinking about
9,you talk about what
9,the problem with the
9,why dont we just
9,you think we have
9,its not in the
9,look at all the
9,they are sort of
9,in the book we
9,how we think about
9,the government and the
9,understand whats going on
9,to give them a
9,and what they do
9,need to be done
9,what it takes to
9,are going to try
9,you can make a
9,huge amount of money
9,and so it was
9,because i think thats
9,going to have any
9,theres a bunch of
9,something like that but
9,in the other direction
9,out of the way
9,russ so you are
9,sector of the economy
9,those kinds of things
9,part of the process
9,to where it was
9,and some of it
9,make it hard for
9,on the theory of
9,sort of like the
9,is a bunch of
9,i want to focus
9,we have the same
9,along the way and
9,bottom line is that
9,and the problem with
9,that is that it
9,may not be a
9,want to do this
9,talk about is the
9,of the year and
9,going to happen in
9,so lets turn to
9,lot of people that
9,if it is a
9,the way the system
9,turned out not to
9,tend to think about
9,demonstrate to men how
9,many of the things
9,you have to worry
9,and put it in
9,to a place where
9,in a small group
9,are likely to be
9,know if thats true
9,what used to be
9,to be interested in
9,you think about this
9,a sense of the
9,of the people i
9,it might be that
9,that have to do
9,if you were in
9,in many ways a
9,on the nature of
9,weve talked about it
9,with low levels of
9,to a group of
9,the goods and services
9,because it would be
9,why did that happen
9,we ought to do
9,united states is that
9,is that when we
9,the question is whats
9,the fact that theres
9,guest i agree with
9,you to think about
9,and of course in
9,the good old days
9,or it could be
9,what you have is
9,that if we could
9,the federal reserve bank
9,to the other side
9,because it was a
9,i like to say
9,thats the sort of
9,going to do is
9,how do you keep
9,are going to work
9,problem is that the
9,long periods of time
9,and as long as
9,not so good for
9,a way that is
9,would have had a
9,on a daily basis
9,you put it in
9,they didnt have a
9,as long as its
9,the course of a
9,in a time when
9,a little bit so
9,as to whether or
9,you are not allowed
9,there is so much
9,about the impact of
9,fannie and freddie were
9,and if we are
9,theory of money and
9,about that is that
9,are you worried about
9,russ yeah guest so
9,i want to raise
9,the people you are
9,russ yeah thats a
9,and in a way
9,how do you explain
9,you dont like the
9,communicate with each other
9,dont know what you
9,lot of money on
9,that i think it
9,and that could be
9,of time and place
9,want to be the
9,think that is a
9,you could do it
9,the united states than
9,dont think we are
9,dont spend a lot
9,their standard of living
9,i do want to
9,why is there a
9,it in a different
9,back up for a
9,as a result they
9,and that is what
9,well there is a
9,which used to be
9,i know you dont
9,not talking about the
9,we can do is
9,i think they do
9,i can give you
9,the federal government and
9,we know what the
9,played an important role
9,russ i dont think
9,they dont know what
9,the united states have
9,by the way but
9,places in the world
9,of the economy but
9,to be something that
9,reason for that is
9,youre not going to
9,of the economy so
9,social security and medicare
9,the most out of
9,some of the most
9,pay a price for
9,the implications of that
9,spending a lot of
9,we got rid of
9,a lot of examples
9,how the world works
9,we want to know
9,i have to go
9,at the height of
9,in the price level
9,true that if you
9,the millennium development goals
9,im going to start
9,the 1920s and 1930s
9,to sell it to
9,lot of people to
9,in these kinds of
9,so as a consequence
9,so if you were
9,to figure out which
9,end of the story
9,i want to hear
9,standard of living and
9,the other hand there
9,and so you can
9,was thought to be
9,start by talking about
9,the future of the
9,i think theres something
9,i think that one
9,and do you think
9,in the right way
9,is a good idea
9,make the case for
9,you talk about it
9,the book is about
9,does not have a
9,at a lot of
9,if i were to
9,in some kind of
9,and in some cases
9,i want to put
9,the next 5 years
9,the same thing but
9,you dont know whether
9,to do that in
9,to the u of
9,there is only one
9,the point that the
9,and say this is
9,they might have been
9,have this kind of
9,but i dont want
9,money into the economy
9,with the kind of
9,way to describe it
9,to demonstrate to men
9,to a kind of
9,that in the united
9,not an expert on
9,do things that are
9,so that we can
9,a very high level
9,yeah and i think
9,by the rules of
9,that they were going
9,the fact of the
9,feature not a bug
9,in the last 25
9,this all the time
9,by an invisible hand
9,that are on the
9,it might be true
9,not the same thing
9,so you can have
9,i think it does
9,and it was very
9,i think there will
9,of the idea that
9,i think thats just
9,obvious to me that
9,for example in the
9,they are worried about
9,is if you have
9,another way to say
9,people back to work
9,they dont need to
9,of the story is
9,what might we do
9,is that if the
9,theres a little bit
9,part of the world
9,to make a profit
9,russ i totally agree
9,are going to change
9,so they are going
9,i wouldnt want to
9,it was published in
9,into the united states
9,a great example of
9,a while and then
9,a guest on this
9,are talking about you
9,is how do we
9,to make it a
9,higher standard of living
9,of the people that
9,is that because of
9,the government has to
9,its more than that
9,we have to work
9,is in terms of
9,will be interesting to
9,of the population of
9,you a little bit
9,of things that we
9,depending on how you
9,and the way you
9,to do these things
9,the top of my
9,low levels of education
9,on the same page
9,i know a lot
9,that it is not
9,think its very important
9,the government out of
9,so why dont you
9,have a number of
9,point is that if
9,it comes back to
9,bear stearns and lehman
9,a lot of young
9,it so i think
9,the labor market and
9,to the financial sector
9,of the world so
9,fight of the century
9,im going to say
9,that came out of
9,whats going on here
9,so that if you
9,there is a problem
9,that was sort of
9,russ thats right guest
9,to make it easy
9,guest i think you
9,willing to pay a
9,i think the fundamental
9,of things going on
9,than in the united
9,of the difference between
9,imagine a world where
9,to get a good
9,was in favor of
9,keep an eye on
9,is to think about
9,and as a consequence
9,of this as a
9,like it to be
9,well i agree with
9,it really is a
9,spending in the economy
9,talk about the role
9,between the two of
9,we are willing to
9,to pay for that
9,when you are not
9,would have been the
9,we talk about this
9,a whole set of
9,its true that the
9,a lot of debt
9,the first thing to
9,and when you are
9,its hard to make
9,the will of the
9,this is in the
9,the united states at
9,i cant remember the
9,if you think you
9,have to pay back
9,to get into a
9,have a couple of
9,of it but i
9,are in favor of
9,weve talked about this
9,do with the fact
9,the expansion of the
9,to that kind of
9,about the history of
9,do that i think
9,i have a very
9,that if you dont
9,to get a little
9,as a form of
9,and then you had
9,when you are trying
9,is it that the
9,one of the major
9,the philosophy of science
9,because its hard to
9,do all kinds of
9,to be skeptical of
9,in the book where
9,i want to buy
9,a large fraction of
9,lots of things that
9,dont know how many
9,it would seem to
9,to react to that
9,a reasonable amount of
9,so the first thing
9,parts of the economy
9,a small part of
9,so i have a
9,we see in the
9,go back into the
9,figuring out how to
9,at the time the
9,really want to do
9,talk about why you
9,for a long long
9,which is that when
9,think this is the
9,and what you think
9,they want to have
9,what we dont know
9,hard to get a
9,but you are right
9,you had to be
9,a system in which
9,in a way i
9,with a bunch of
9,the perspective of the
9,a little bit skeptical
9,not just that we
9,i want to add
9,to do what we
9,it may be a
9,of the reason is
9,in part because of
9,if you can get
9,there were people who
9,all the way through
9,if you ask people
9,to go out of
9,i think the more
9,over the age of
9,just dont want to
9,thats hard to do
9,if you are talking
9,so how do you
9,out to be very
9,you look at that
9,that have been made
9,and in the end
9,that part of it
9,with some of the
9,well im going to
9,i have a lot
9,and this is where
9,it would be the
9,in the economy but
9,to have a big
9,and the kind of
9,that they were not
9,because you dont want
9,going to see a
9,there might be some
9,no reason to think
9,what it does is
9,that we care about
9,when they are not
9,to do if you
9,i think about that
9,it in the united
9,is a set of
9,suppose you are a
9,reduce the amount of
9,that they are doing
9,is not enough to
9,guest and i think
9,so there is some
9,know that they are
9,that have nothing to
9,of the book and
9,that they would have
9,what you might call
9,it but i dont
9,to do a good
9,to make sure we
9,the lender of last
9,a lot to be
9,the unemployment rate is
9,what they want to
9,people who live in
9,they thought they were
9,dont want to make
9,is it just a
9,the difference in the
9,think some of the
9,an important role in
9,a lot harder to
9,we are not in
9,not going to make
9,one at a time
9,be better off if
9,take that into account
9,like to think that
9,agree with you but
9,guest yeah its a
9,that by the way
9,so if we are
9,the value of your
9,great depression and the
9,more likely to have
9,of course you can
9,that when you get
9,whether or not the
9,having to do with
9,to try to understand
9,its just the way
9,thats why we have
9,more people who are
9,want their kids to
9,this is a little
9,and its very hard
9,some of these things
9,it might have been
9,if you are just
9,that allows us to
9,try to get a
9,a certain number of
9,idea that you can
9,the point where they
9,is the road to
9,on this issue of
9,to be aware of
9,i think most economists
9,two things that are
9,we have to pay
9,to figure out whats
9,a lot of new
9,of course we are
9,go all the way
9,i think thats where
9,and you dont know
9,the flip side of
9,its not a very
9,you want it to
9,today is your book
9,i think its pretty
9,do whatever you want
9,so i have to
9,dont disagree with that
9,you talk in the
9,have to go through
9,one of the fascinating
9,how can it be
9,it is its a
9,they want to do
9,if you go into
9,took place in the
9,guest yes i think
9,in other words you
9,more to do with
9,that when you look
9,the united states of
9,interesting to me that
9,a lot about how
9,of the market and
9,that is a little
9,have much of an
9,dont think it would
9,it comes to the
9,now that we have
9,for most of the
9,the interesting thing about
9,but there is also
9,with the exception of
9,you had to go
9,and i want you
9,where you are going
9,if there were a
9,you have to start
9,a bottle of wine
9,a decline in the
9,lets talk about this
9,have something to do
9,is a bit of
9,to deal with this
9,the early days of
9,and the idea of
9,it was a lot
9,yeah i dont know
9,to the bank and
9,what you end up
9,going to be better
9,russ lets go back
9,in the late 1960s
9,that we have this
9,better safe than sorry
9,you talked about the
9,the same time it
9,to say that i
9,united states and europe
9,is always and everywhere
9,changes in the money
9,a certain set of
9,the economies of scale
9,to the cost of
9,you point out the
9,have a pretty good
9,to the point of
9,you have in mind
9,this and i think
9,did a podcast with
9,going to let you
9,what you see is
9,what you call the
9,goods and services that
9,a lot going on
9,you look at these
9,dont know whats going
9,have a central bank
9,point of view and
9,is an increase in
9,you dont need a
9,of course when you
9,things i want to
9,in the room and
9,i think you could
9,to be the ones
9,the banks in the
9,the criminal justice system
9,of the way we
9,guest yeah i mean
9,i will say that
9,as soon as i
9,dont know the answer
9,law of large numbers
9,this is what we
9,figure out a way
9,is that it has
9,i think they would
9,that the average person
9,is i think the
9,on the economics of
9,we dont do that
9,i read your book
9,would have been much
9,20 million in cash
9,has been a lot
9,what we are trying
9,to say something about
9,that you dont know
9,play a role in
9,when you try to
9,which is part of
9,to make sure the
9,in a place where
9,by the way its
9,do that you can
9,the way they do
9,and those are the
9,a lot of talk
9,is that going to
9,there would be an
9,in the demand for
9,money in the bank
9,were part of the
9,what you are really
9,you really need to
9,best thing to do
9,we have to worry
9,and more and more
9,is that it was
9,the same time as
9,the size of a
9,we can do it
9,the runup to the
9,think we should be
9,its hard to get
9,in the rate of
9,a big increase in
9,of it i think
9,up in the morning
9,so one way to
9,are looking at the
9,of that if you
9,we all understand that
9,of the central bank
9,and they have to
9,the question would be
9,is to make the
9,i think that what
9,the united kingdom and
9,trying to get a
9,ways that are not
9,optimistic about the future
9,thats the right way
9,try to do that
9,comes up with a
9,but of course you
9,in the current world
9,about some of these
9,to your point about
9,about that kind of
9,in terms of his
9,to say anything else
9,and then the next
9,in terms of our
9,it looks like the
9,there is a debate
9,source of the problem
9,it because i think
9,was a time when
9,going to vote for
9,you can see the
9,large part of the
9,the amount of time
9,of too big to
9,out of it and
9,make the point that
9,as a result we
9,over goods and services
9,dont really want to
9,to say that we
9,to see if they
9,response to that is
9,at the united states
9,this is where the
9,of the fed and
9,want to build a
9,on the program before
9,some people in the
9,that has nothing to
9,will have to be
9,is it that we
9,you say you are
9,but those are the
9,in a variety of
9,the last few decades
9,and to the extent
9,when you get a
9,to go to school
9,people on both sides
9,this is kind of
9,that the cost of
9,would be a better
9,that is not a
9,guest well if you
9,but of course it
9,the united states over
9,one side of the
9,which is of course
9,what we talked about
9,of us in the
9,hard to figure out
9,but not a lot
9,dont know if it
9,you think there is
9,into the hands of
9,a lot of risk
9,all going to be
9,we going to do
9,that it can be
9,who are willing to
9,the way that you
9,whats your response to
9,these kind of things
9,youve got to get
9,that was part of
9,everybody is going to
9,a situation where you
9,what is called the
9,of whether or not
8,some of the problems
8,are talking about and
8,is it going to
8,that youve got to
8,so its not a
8,do you think this
8,that because i think
8,so lets start with
8,try to do something
8,million dollars a year
8,a bunch of other
8,were able to do
8,of course its a
8,want to get back
8,to read the book
8,of you out there
8,have more and more
8,is the thing that
8,you think of it
8,the world food program
8,that one is that
8,one and a half
8,them because they are
8,a little bit you
8,to me is a
8,to go up and
8,i just dont see
8,does that have to
8,would be to get
8,a little less than
8,international monetary fund imf
8,and there were a
8,not a big deal
8,that the fed has
8,it a little more
8,to get their money
8,was a kind of
8,used to be in
8,is the source of
8,but its important to
8,a lot of economic
8,the fact that this
8,to say its not
8,were going to take
8,say we need to
8,because there are no
8,we like to think
8,is in some sense
8,had something to do
8,in the public sector
8,guest yeah and i
8,was at the time
8,there are some things
8,am i going to
8,a small portion of
8,play out in the
8,of it is in
8,of what you said
8,and so on the
8,is this a good
8,in the range of
8,a fraction of the
8,value of the yuan
8,mess we are in
8,the same thing is
8,point of view is
8,and there are many
8,are going to learn
8,it would be in
8,that the economy is
8,to make their own
8,talk about what happened
8,to look to the
8,very close to the
8,we dont seem to
8,tell us what you
8,the bottom half of
8,you can take a
8,are going to spend
8,can do it and
8,the real question is
8,dont know who is
8,of this kind of
8,the result of that
8,the american society of
8,a company that is
8,and when i say
8,know if this is
8,im a little more
8,think part of it
8,is going to pay
8,but most people dont
8,how important is it
8,these are people who
8,thats what i mean
8,want to say to
8,in my view the
8,of the world in
8,is i dont know
8,not supposed to be
8,is that you know
8,there is too much
8,to start from scratch
8,i dont know where
8,little they really know
8,but how do you
8,that i would have
8,russ so lets get
8,lot of the people
8,guest so this is
8,and thats the way
8,it is that people
8,even when they are
8,im with you there
8,look at it in
8,goes on in the
8,think this is where
8,go back to that
8,the book that i
8,russ so one of
8,is not a single
8,know what that means
8,it is based on
8,a lot less than
8,a good thing i
8,its an interesting question
8,thing we have to
8,how do you do
8,and they had a
8,if we are not
8,about that in a
8,inflation is always and
8,and you are talking
8,where they come from
8,why do you say
8,russ that would be
8,they think they are
8,the sense that he
8,idea that there are
8,the way to think
8,it came out in
8,it was a little
8,in terms of trying
8,on and on and
8,one side or the
8,know what the right
8,of the matter is
8,whats the difference between
8,of what we might
8,do i have to
8,so for example if
8,and thats what we
8,had a chance to
8,they thought it was
8,i think that will
8,my claim is that
8,we had in the
8,on all kinds of
8,the 19th century and
8,than it would have
8,i want to see
8,to a number of
8,to do it so
8,i cant think of
8,you look at how
8,that even if you
8,there is a market
8,things in the world
8,thats an example of
8,when i looked at
8,to get all the
8,russ do you want
8,couple of things that
8,we have a system
8,didnt want to be
8,in the way they
8,for some of the
8,what we need is
8,lose a lot of
8,part of the brain
8,and the cost of
8,one way to do
8,the way they were
8,much of a difference
8,to work in the
8,not the kind of
8,you have any thoughts
8,the claim is that
8,would be great if
8,for today is your
8,in the air and
8,so it looks like
8,and many of the
8,so talk about the
8,there is a temptation
8,that the person who
8,same thing is true
8,its going to get
8,i wrote the book
8,of the issues that
8,where we have to
8,yeah i think its
8,and of course you
8,of all of the
8,thing is that the
8,hard to make the
8,the short run and
8,do the kind of
8,lot of money into
8,if they are going
8,and what that means
8,that the us government
8,worse than we thought
8,have no problem with
8,chapter in the book
8,so let me ask
8,is a temptation to
8,the last part of
8,argument is that the
8,what weve been talking
8,its going to look
8,see this in the
8,on the internet and
8,get rid of them
8,and weve talked about
8,the thing is that
8,way its going to
8,obviously there are many
8,guest oh i think
8,have the power to
8,so the way that
8,fact that there was
8,it would be like
8,come back and talk
8,that would be my
8,which to me is
8,dont have a very
8,that as long as
8,going on right now
8,but i would say
8,lot to be said
8,lot of people were
8,so let me just
8,it seems to have
8,austrian business cycle theory
8,to be very good
8,to say they are
8,an example of that
8,it is i think
8,for today is the
8,many of the people
8,it but its not
8,dont have access to
8,get in the way
8,country in the world
8,true that in the
8,do you really think
8,try to think about
8,and i said well
8,do we really want
8,guest first of all
8,you know what i
8,that if you do
8,and in the case
8,could be part of
8,so long as they
8,the history of economic
8,thing to keep in
8,to move away from
8,would not be able
8,they would have to
8,find it hard to
8,and on and on
8,one of the virtues
8,think were going to
8,in the market for
8,by the name of
8,the rate of time
8,fact of the matter
8,the result of the
8,reason to think that
8,the side of the
8,can get out of
8,dont know if that
8,there are other ways
8,to have a good
8,to be a big
8,i dont see any
8,were a number of
8,guest well you know
8,a lot of resources
8,know a little bit
8,that you are a
8,has been a very
8,what he called the
8,will of the people
8,and it kind of
8,this part of the
8,the way back to
8,one that i think
8,thats not a very
8,want to say about
8,but we dont know
8,has the potential to
8,have any thoughts on
8,in front of congress
8,things and i think
8,they have an incentive
8,you can see how
8,we need to make
8,actually one of the
8,trying to create a
8,think it was the
8,but its not so
8,do you get that
8,that the problem is
8,is what it is
8,coming back to the
8,of the book which
8,but before i do
8,be the kind of
8,to say that it
8,so they are not
8,and they tend to
8,you dont have that
8,the things we are
8,are able to do
8,they are doing it
8,way i think about
8,answer to your question
8,on the asset side
8,in any given year
8,that are in the
8,we see is that
8,england journal of medicine
8,whats interesting is that
8,the sense that we
8,its not a big
8,had to do it
8,the change in the
8,dont know exactly how
8,by talking about the
8,you can try to
8,it might be a
8,just to take an
8,that the government has
8,this is what the
8,you point out they
8,over the last 5
8,think is a very
8,the whole point of
8,guest well there are
8,that we need a
8,lets come back to
8,is to talk about
8,going to be one
8,in line with the
8,the first thing we
8,the other things that
8,you know you can
8,to the bottom of
8,its not a coincidence
8,if it were a
8,came up with the
8,is that true guest
8,the top 1 and
8,you do that and
8,so in the case
8,to get into it
8,if the united states
8,been a little bit
8,monetary policy in the
8,the same thing and
8,but not as much
8,book and i think
8,go back to what
8,we have to start
8,i think many people
8,a way that i
8,look at that and
8,as the united states
8,russ thats a good
8,a result of a
8,this would be a
8,you start to see
8,to stay away from
8,that is the way
8,but they are really
8,dont want to suggest
8,to get the right
8,journal of economic perspectives
8,guest well let me
8,weve talked about before
8,this is a great
8,why are they doing
8,the burden of the
8,guest well this is
8,first of all you
8,you would have a
8,if we dont have
8,it has nothing to
8,question is is it
8,that we were going
8,to see what the
8,that were talking about
8,of the balance sheet
8,as you do in
8,has to be some
8,to be wiped out
8,and some of those
8,its much harder to
8,i think the first
8,in the opposite direction
8,they are doing something
8,as soon as the
8,you cant just say
8,have all kinds of
8,it turned out to
8,that i have to
8,people out there who
8,very well in the
8,the high school level
8,the way a lot
8,and it could be
8,it tends to be
8,there were a number
8,is a tendency to
8,about the way that
8,raise the price of
8,the reality is that
8,a number of other
8,no one is going
8,dont know if i
8,about some of those
8,in the book a
8,instead of trying to
8,and that i think
8,the means of production
8,we are in this
8,its a form of
8,of the time you
8,and they are still
8,to be a great
8,in the book on
8,so thats sort of
8,we are making progress
8,on the right side
8,be the end of
8,are saying is that
8,there is a great
8,see that as a
8,not good for the
8,he was onto something
8,im very sympathetic to
8,how its going to
8,what do you see
8,makes a huge difference
8,want to give it
8,tend to be very
8,do that in a
8,i cant tell you
8,think it was in
8,a result of this
8,lot of time and
8,the middle of nowhere
8,you get a different
8,new england journal of
8,of the public sector
8,hard to understand why
8,one is that we
8,a very very long
8,for a long period
8,have to do to
8,and in fact it
8,to the amount of
8,which a lot of
8,dont think thats the
8,its not like we
8,at the low end
8,banks in the united
8,say you have to
8,been talking about and
8,that it would have
8,they are in a
8,there is a difference
8,have to know what
8,the next few years
8,command over goods and
8,because i dont want
8,the very end of
8,the most interesting thing
8,and be able to
8,to disagree with you
8,was that they had
8,they want to get
8,at the federal reserve
8,dont want to give
8,people want to go
8,now we are going
8,is a great example
8,a person who is
8,it didnt turn out
8,easy for me to
8,and figure out how
8,of the economy in
8,take a couple of
8,side or the other
8,question i want to
8,sympathetic to that view
8,at the data and
8,of people trying to
8,look at the evidence
8,is that what you
8,to talk about some
8,look to the future
8,they came up with
8,you are right i
8,and this is one
8,lot of what you
8,russ yeah well i
8,to move to a
8,is trying to do
8,you are an economist
8,you think thats a
8,it is certainly true
8,and then they are
8,small part of the
8,to come out of
8,to give it away
8,so thats what i
8,as a result you
8,a small amount of
8,how to make a
8,now part of that
8,to give you the
8,of the new york
8,and it was just
8,do what they want
8,what we do know
8,all the time in
8,the authors of the
8,top of my head
8,is that a fair
8,much of an impact
8,how much of a
8,in my view is
8,and the financial sector
8,its just a matter
8,whats really going on
8,a few of the
8,make the argument that
8,matter of time before
8,the problem is if
8,as long as we
8,the sense that its
8,the worst case scenario
8,the time you get
8,that monetary policy is
8,might think of as
8,interesting things to say
8,another way to think
8,and what kind of
8,in the labor force
8,order to do that
8,a long time but
8,in favor of that
8,of different kinds of
8,remains to be seen
8,there is sort of
8,a tragedy of the
8,are going to keep
8,think thats a huge
8,more than anything else
8,we now have a
8,it as if it
8,even though you are
8,so much in the
8,make it easy for
8,do you think guest
8,how do you find
8,to make it harder
8,in fact they are
8,in the production of
8,out of the depression
8,in some of these
8,the funny thing is
8,want to have the
8,the same time we
8,they know what they
8,then were going to
8,with the idea of
8,is going to give
8,there are still a
8,as a whole and
8,other hand if you
8,takes a lot of
8,the stock market and
8,to be people who
8,to say anything about
8,going to be something
8,when you are done
8,it if you are
8,you look at those
8,of it is not
8,to do was to
8,the easiest way to
8,so thats the first
8,about the virtues of
8,the issue of the
8,that goes back to
8,up a bunch of
8,countries in the world
8,more and more and
8,when you say the
8,you can see this
8,are actually going to
8,is in charge of
8,of the top 1
8,you have no idea
8,the next 50 years
8,a good time to
8,a lot more expensive
8,out there trying to
8,when we come to
8,that we can get
8,problem is that we
8,when you have an
8,is the person who
8,are you talking about
8,in the past that
8,a lot of power
8,that they would be
8,the fed to do
8,that if you take
8,out in the world
8,know there is a
8,guest well one of
8,the money in the
8,try to do is
8,the kind of things
8,way and i think
8,are the things that
8,i dont believe the
8,to the conclusion that
8,that if you think
8,as much as it
8,hard to tease out
8,wall street and the
8,of health care and
8,the last three years
8,to talk to people
8,of the people you
8,history of the world
8,i went to a
8,theres all sorts of
8,get to a point
8,and then i want
8,80 million in loans
8,where does that leave
8,the economy is growing
8,to state and local
8,dont think there are
8,not only do you
8,it is not the
8,the way i would
8,many ways in which
8,of what they were
8,and people who are
8,and so its not
8,and of course thats
8,that in a way
8,what hes saying is
8,people who dont know
8,to figure out whether
8,i didnt want to
8,i think of the
8,rather than trying to
8,that in a little
8,how easy it is
8,that the number of
8,you think of a
8,of thinking about the
8,people who are just
8,i would love to
8,this time is different
8,is that the united
8,this idea that we
8,the federal reserve the
8,you need to make
8,that they are very
8,about our ability to
8,out of the country
8,see this as a
8,exactly the opposite of
8,i think thats very
8,that i would be
8,the united states where
8,do think theres a
8,money out of the
8,this was going to
8,think that theres a
8,the absence of the
8,the state and local
8,keep up with the
8,for all kinds of
8,there is i think
8,who was going to
8,what we know and
8,something that i think
8,a higher rate of
8,is part of what
8,big increase in the
8,of people who want
8,russ so if i
8,but not in the
8,even if its not
8,it was a bad
8,for two reasons one
8,are talking about it
8,the great depression that
8,in the market place
8,up the demand for
8,the last 100 years
8,a new kind of
8,of course its not
8,with you i think
8,and thats what they
8,walk away from the
8,you pay for it
8,is they have a
8,how little they really
8,but of course its
8,and the reason we
8,but i think theres
8,if you could just
8,to encourage people to
8,the end of a
8,that its not just
8,that at the end
8,live in a society
8,go to law school
8,well i think there
8,you think that the
8,the way we do
8,the chair of the
8,if you give them
8,a situation where the
8,we are all going
8,wanted to talk about
8,my first thought is
8,you are dealing with
8,they say they are
8,say we have to
8,you see in the
8,that would seem to
8,to respond to that
8,much more complicated than
8,in your book you
8,but if there is
8,thats not the case
8,the new england journal
8,if you are interested
8,let me go back
8,the example of the
8,of the reason why
8,that way i think
8,to be hard to
8,it on the other
8,but there are also
8,to know what the
8,to bring it back
8,and even if you
8,of the minimum wage
8,and the thing that
8,i do think its
8,if it had been
8,that im not sure
8,have to get the
8,thoughts on that guest
8,now we are in
8,of the time the
8,what has happened to
8,it raises the question
8,to come back and
8,of the stock market
8,that may not be
8,not only are they
8,you look at this
8,be able to afford
8,doesnt mean its not
8,but they have a
8,and thats sort of
8,the federal communications commission
8,claim is that the
8,there was a great
8,there might have been
8,can do is to
8,once you have a
8,to make it better
8,about it in a
8,book one of the
8,to one of the
8,that would have a
8,doesnt make any sense
8,of the millennium villages
8,long way to go
8,its not that you
8,would be better off
8,almost out of time
8,to make it easier
8,in a particular way
8,of these kinds of
8,you want me to
8,i just think its
8,is not to be
8,so far as to
8,how do you make
8,back to the point
8,think there is some
8,and talk about the
8,in the savings and
8,did a lot of
8,know a lot more
8,out of the great
8,of course one of
8,you could get a
8,a whole series of
8,this is sort of
8,in the last 3
8,look at the other
8,do we have a
8,is we have to
8,term capital management ltcm
8,that there are very
8,point of view that
8,it and then you
8,so on the one
8,i think its worth
8,of the reasons we
8,a response to the
8,the united states on
8,to make a living
8,that there was some
8,like to talk about
8,point of view but
8,but they have to
8,all the other things
8,are going to give
8,a few minutes ago
8,how thats going to
8,is a debate about
8,there is a sort
8,it easier for people
8,those are the ones
8,to have to pay
8,go to college and
8,im not an expert
8,russ but as you
8,i think it will
8,is you have to
8,cant go on forever
8,guest i think theres
8,been part of the
8,made it easier to
8,so on and i
8,agree with you on
8,that we are making
8,to talk to you
8,going to ask you
8,in the future so
8,right now we are
8,no one wants to
8,there was no way
8,thats the way its
8,there are two reasons
8,in the early 20th
8,of course it was
8,out to be wrong
8,there and i think
8,which is really a
8,thats sort of a
8,the financial system is
8,is a part of
8,idea that we would
8,more interested in the
8,its the same thing
8,top marginal tax rate
8,there is a way
8,that there are no
8,in the white house
8,in the financial system
8,that the way we
8,of people who say
8,of the increase in
8,and whats going on
8,as it is in
8,its easy to say
8,a problem in the
8,going out of business
8,you talk about some
8,first i want to
8,same is true of
8,people and i think
8,role in the economy
8,want to use the
8,what do you want
8,what do they do
8,in a way they
8,he was talking about
8,dont have a job
8,so in order to
8,so when we talk
8,i am not a
8,its got to be
8,the first year of
8,and then when they
8,that we didnt have
8,the relationship between the
8,russ why do you
8,russ well let me
8,the concept of the
8,dont have a good
8,of the problem that
8,russ so this is
8,is the one you
8,of the reason we
8,of your immune system
8,so we dont have
8,couple of years and
8,hard to imagine that
8,made it easier for
8,i want to know
8,and i have talked
8,which is related to
8,the department of labor
8,first of all it
8,what it was in
8,there are other people
8,not so much in
8,over the last 15
8,of the american economy
8,if they have a
8,of the free market
8,thats exactly right and
8,dont just want to
8,thats a huge part
8,the magnitude of the
8,think about it i
8,you also have to
8,in the last 15
8,about it if you
8,to keep track of
8,think it would have
8,and they dont want
8,that there was an
8,a little more money
8,there a lot of
8,a look at the
8,the expense of the
8,the fact that when
8,not going to change
8,so when you are
8,make it hard to
8,and all of the
8,who is willing to
8,because i dont think
8,what can you do
8,a lot of kids
8,would say that the
8,you do with the
8,weve got to get
8,a big impact on
8,i think those are
8,an example of the
8,going to get their
8,the sense that it
8,things like that that
8,you think we should
8,the fact that these
8,that it should be
8,and the only way
8,on to the next
8,and by the time
8,so i think a
8,sectors of the economy
8,only way you can
8,by the time they
8,of the health care
8,one of them was
8,that is i think
8,a period of time
8,at the london school
8,the moral high ground
8,what we know about
8,russ so in the
8,they were not going
8,if people want to
8,that can lead to
8,talk about how that
8,is if you want
8,would be nice to
8,correct me if im
8,it and of course
8,times as much as
8,have a set of
8,is not good for
8,and that kind of
8,there are many things
8,you and i both
8,i wish we had
8,just a lot of
8,in the world at
8,having a lot of
8,i think they were
8,by the way they
8,i would want to
8,that turns out to
8,like that and then
8,the other hand you
8,that the fed was
8,the only way we
8,the market price and
8,dont want to lose
8,its going to go
8,they really know about
8,are talking about this
8,the world around us
8,we dont know that
8,i dont see why
8,that is due to
8,they need to do
8,want you to talk
8,what happens in a
8,how do i know
8,so i agree with
8,that guest well i
8,the idea that it
8,a way that you
8,because there are a
8,to that guest well
8,guest well i dont
8,not going to just
8,in the world we
8,it seems like the
8,than in the past
8,are all going to
8,russ well lets talk
8,two things going on
8,right now i think
8,not going to say
8,to think they are
8,i want to bring
8,to be made that
8,as we talked about
8,in the house of
8,there was a sense
8,is that the people
8,and those of us
8,by the way thats
8,your response to that
8,pay more attention to
8,then there is a
8,this has been a
8,3 or 4 years
8,to be said for
8,in the last year
8,which is a lot
8,to step in and
8,that thats going to
8,and i think i
8,its extremely difficult to
8,of trial and error
8,and what did you
8,have to think of
8,something like that russ
8,they have to pay
8,are probably going to
8,its interesting to me
8,have an interest in
8,its very hard for
8,are really going to
8,so why dont we
8,economies of scale and
8,want to get a
8,its a very small
8,in the road to
8,think if you look
8,a couple of days
8,that i am not
8,harder and harder to
8,of what kind of
8,have come up with
8,of what it is
8,year in and year
8,in order to have
8,the things i think
8,it doesnt matter whether
8,a little bit to
8,is that you get
8,then you look at
8,you are right and
8,didnt want to get
8,what they did was
8,guest a lot of
8,in favor of a
8,so many other things
8,in marginal tax rates
8,very good job of
8,thats the nature of
8,it does seem to
8,in the past so
7,to do a little
7,would have been to
7,is not the right
7,so i think what
7,that that was the
7,was going on and
7,that at the time
7,what they actually do
7,the title of the
7,i go to the
7,but the bottom line
7,to raise interest rates
7,and so on i
7,as a result there
7,evidence do we have
7,on and i think
7,as well as you
7,the united states people
7,those sorts of things
7,where i think the
7,very long time and
7,i think its one
7,hour and a half
7,changed in the last
7,thought a lot about
7,turns out not to
7,in other words they
7,i think your point
7,going to take it
7,you are much more
7,but its an interesting
7,say that i think
7,there will always be
7,people in a room
7,move on to some
7,in math and science
7,the other side who
7,reaction to that guest
7,which is hard to
7,i have to pay
7,of money and the
7,the housing market and
7,we really care about
7,lot of other people
7,back up a little
7,the number of jobs
7,if the economy is
7,about it its not
7,the market is going
7,it would turn out
7,its so hard to
7,we saw in the
7,that we dont get
7,we can do better
7,should be allowed to
7,to me that we
7,the same time he
7,a book called the
7,going to be paid
7,so when i think
7,on in the book
7,going to happen to
7,of a sudden they
7,united states we have
7,to try to give
7,out in front of
7,least in the united
7,you point out a
7,than the market price
7,but when you are
7,anxious about the future
7,has been a big
7,i dont think anyone
7,of the welfare state
7,and there are lots
7,weve already talked about
7,what we want is
7,could have been a
7,a couple of hours
7,and i had a
7,and to be able
7,the proportion of the
7,thats what i would
7,and you need to
7,even if we dont
7,yeah i think the
7,to talk about but
7,to say that they
7,to get better at
7,what has to happen
7,you have to use
7,talk about what that
7,every one of the
7,because its going to
7,a good idea and
7,that in the book
7,know its going to
7,by the way there
7,on the street and
7,the moral hazard problem
7,of what i call
7,so many things that
7,on the people who
7,of the problems of
7,im a skeptic about
7,tends to be more
7,is you are going
7,is the same as
7,end of the 1970s
7,the balance sheet of
7,know whats going to
7,russ so if you
7,who are in charge
7,get away with it
7,the people who want
7,a lot of americans
7,going to get any
7,want to suggest that
7,that this is going
7,there is a good
7,fact that they were
7,if you could get
7,to try to find
7,russ by the way
7,i wanted to talk
7,we could look at
7,so im sympathetic to
7,would like to be
7,the problem we have
7,because you want to
7,which was published in
7,deposit insurance corporation improvement
7,what we see in
7,it as well as
7,hard to think of
7,to bail out the
7,hard for them to
7,do as well as
7,what should we do
7,situation in which the
7,the value of that
7,push comes to shove
7,very hard to measure
7,had a little bit
7,of a sudden the
7,if you know you
7,in more energy than
7,and they had to
7,the pretense of knowledge
7,whatever it is that
7,think that you can
7,and you can make
7,the reason why i
7,such thing as the
7,of the costs and
7,who are interested in
7,nature and causes of
7,but we do have
7,of it is because
7,its a very good
7,is a function of
7,of the book i
7,want to get out
7,the president has to
7,for the last 30
7,of the fed the
7,book is about the
7,russ so i think
7,likely you are to
7,russ when you say
7,not the only thing
7,whats been happening to
7,to assume that the
7,so my question is
7,the sense that you
7,think thats right i
7,not be the best
7,it the case that
7,and on top of
7,of a kind of
7,so in a sense
7,the time and i
7,or whatever it was
7,when we have a
7,might we do to
7,because they are so
7,a lot more in
7,of course it is
7,to give up something
7,but there are lots
7,you are entitled to
7,guest im not sure
7,can do it with
7,to have to have
7,the people with the
7,i think i would
7,did the same thing
7,but what i found
7,so those are the
7,of the world they
7,so if you take
7,interest rates in the
7,it ought to be
7,that doesnt seem to
7,from the standpoint of
7,at the moment i
7,and then you are
7,expect it to be
7,to be out of
7,and so in a
7,in the world today
7,the economy in the
7,if we got rid
7,do what they do
7,a lot of innovation
7,there was a huge
7,the book about the
7,the house and senate
7,patterns of sustainable specialization
7,im going to challenge
7,which is what is
7,that would be very
7,things like that and
7,there is a case
7,look at it from
7,problem which is that
7,what happened to the
7,for all of the
7,a very good question
7,but it was not
7,was a student of
7,a different way of
7,a lot of private
7,the single most important
7,know how much of
7,road to serfdom and
7,the fact that weve
7,a guest on econtalk
7,a whole lot more
7,you just need to
7,but its not really
7,parts of the country
7,what you think of
7,the federal government to
7,the national football league
7,the sense in which
7,is going to grow
7,not be the same
7,to come to a
7,other countries in the
7,russ so talk about
7,that you are in
7,the effectiveness of the
7,and they are just
7,just the way it
7,most of the cost
7,can get away with
7,than it is today
7,if you had your
7,kind of thing and
7,than 50 years ago
7,you are in that
7,have to take it
7,and he said well
7,i actually think that
7,lot of time to
7,talk about in a
7,and in the united
7,to keep people from
7,is likely to be
7,the only difference is
7,go up to the
7,russ no doubt guest
7,because they didnt have
7,have a much better
7,as a sort of
7,i dont have an
7,saying im going to
7,dont know about that
7,nobody is going to
7,for people to be
7,fable of the bees
7,going to want to
7,that it was not
7,what he says is
7,think theres some truth
7,but go ahead guest
7,to the state of
7,that that is not
7,on the united states
7,its just that the
7,think the challenge is
7,we also have a
7,that this is an
7,that runs through the
7,about this is that
7,would be an interesting
7,on one of the
7,law of unintended consequences
7,do that in the
7,think so i think
7,out how to do
7,or whatever you want
7,you were able to
7,to get your reaction
7,is a result of
7,about the people who
7,fact that you are
7,going on there guest
7,is the number of
7,but they tend to
7,how does it work
7,and of course i
7,it the other way
7,create a lot of
7,to take that into
7,you have to understand
7,growth in the economy
7,think there would be
7,think its a little
7,and the number of
7,going to show up
7,used to be and
7,of course you are
7,i dont know much
7,of property rights and
7,russ but i think
7,you were to go
7,we thought it was
7,what were going to
7,is never going to
7,and if we can
7,as many people as
7,through a lot of
7,a particular set of
7,they were talking about
7,at the university level
7,going to be on
7,the us government is
7,russ now one of
7,these are things that
7,and so thats why
7,go so far as
7,the number of hours
7,to make things better
7,over the long term
7,circumstances of time and
7,think in some ways
7,get a very different
7,going to go down
7,im with you on
7,and so this is
7,go out there and
7,and so its a
7,the point where it
7,in the english language
7,a little bit less
7,the first half of
7,we do not have
7,the whole system is
7,it the problem is
7,worried about the future
7,part of the way
7,is a role for
7,what would be your
7,on the way to
7,what you are worried
7,is supposed to do
7,its a combination of
7,trying to make a
7,we get into the
7,in terms of your
7,which is sort of
7,deal with the fact
7,i dont think anybody
7,there is lots of
7,in which there are
7,talking about here is
7,the central bank is
7,tend to focus on
7,here at george mason
7,research and development rd
7,have to get a
7,that doesnt mean its
7,to set up a
7,there would be more
7,as well as we
7,wealth of nations is
7,its not at all
7,could come up with
7,very difficult to get
7,many of the same
7,see whats going on
7,we are in now
7,the same thing guest
7,is going to win
7,to give you an
7,them and i think
7,role of government in
7,you and i were
7,you are sort of
7,we could have a
7,a lot of capital
7,will be bailed out
7,dramatically over the last
7,a sense of what
7,trying to do the
7,about the relationship between
7,of government in the
7,but its not like
7,more than it is
7,really need to be
7,not so much the
7,about it a little
7,i think the thing
7,i think its interesting
7,i dont think is
7,two things one is
7,get rid of that
7,which you talk about
7,to say that you
7,lot of those people
7,came up with this
7,the good news is
7,and lots of people
7,and one of my
7,know if it was
7,and go to the
7,are you saying that
7,have to say i
7,it wouldnt have been
7,in one of your
7,the commercial paper market
7,to me and i
7,ability to do that
7,people tend to think
7,at the time we
7,the same time there
7,to stimulate the economy
7,hes not going to
7,i think the whole
7,i talk about this
7,want them to do
7,to make money and
7,that the drug companies
7,talking about you are
7,really want to know
7,its sort of the
7,its a lot harder
7,to do that the
7,is the use of
7,is the cost of
7,over a period of
7,was a good thing
7,i want to challenge
7,a certain level of
7,that we can have
7,made the point that
7,cant get rid of
7,all the way down
7,in the last decade
7,but going back to
7,want to know if
7,how long it takes
7,the government to do
7,the united states what
7,was the head of
7,back to your point
7,the classical gold standard
7,be in the business
7,ways to do that
7,way out of it
7,the idea would be
7,but you still have
7,a long time i
7,that the world is
7,two or three times
7,look at what they
7,i think at the
7,right in front of
7,may not have the
7,you dont even know
7,makes it hard for
7,and so we are
7,a lot of friends
7,are going to die
7,the economic consequences of
7,one could argue that
7,this is an example
7,and i think part
7,guest right and so
7,do you think those
7,know anything about that
7,its not true that
7,so they have a
7,but id like to
7,i do think it
7,do think there is
7,imagine a world in
7,i think the same
7,i think that thats
7,going to be this
7,we might want to
7,creditors of bear stearns
7,that we are spending
7,i dont need to
7,getting a lot of
7,we are not seeing
7,vast majority of the
7,the beginning of this
7,are the kinds of
7,they come up with
7,russ how do you
7,look at the big
7,early days of the
7,dont need as many
7,get back to a
7,in the fatal conceit
7,people who are worried
7,if you took a
7,current state of the
7,they are not so
7,of what was going
7,to the economy and
7,if you were an
7,things you have to
7,just want to make
7,a bad thing but
7,those are the people
7,but i also think
7,you are a little
7,in front of you
7,if you and i
7,we dont have an
7,we didnt talk about
7,to keep the price
7,the problems that we
7,for better or for
7,to compete with the
7,you are better off
7,that we could get
7,than it was in
7,i dont know about
7,going to be good
7,that there might be
7,of what it was
7,the same sort of
7,to the extent they
7,in their own selfinterest
7,been allowed to go
7,that we see in
7,lot of that is
7,it guest yeah i
7,of all i think
7,in the world for
7,a good idea but
7,look at the united
7,a way that was
7,causes of the wealth
7,what he was doing
7,in the economics profession
7,tend to look at
7,he was very much
7,were just going to
7,right way to do
7,a whole host of
7,the late 1990s and
7,to make sense of
7,at the very end
7,its the fact that
7,time you get to
7,that if you just
7,them out of business
7,every one of these
7,what we are seeing
7,of it is a
7,and they have this
7,do you see that
7,as a measure of
7,united states which is
7,as much as a
7,a large amount of
7,and there are two
7,dont want to live
7,to do it russ
7,but we dont really
7,so its very hard
7,of some of these
7,to the private sector
7,and then the question
7,i also want to
7,get a job at
7,you want to live
7,want to say its
7,a big change in
7,is a great deal
7,for the last 20
7,is that we want
7,the idea that its
7,you give the example
7,the question is if
7,because i think the
7,have to keep the
7,and it didnt work
7,so the idea that
7,the glass is half
7,it is a very
7,of the things people
7,think of all the
7,to do with your
7,you can do with
7,2012 russ topic is
7,can be used to
7,of the economy as
7,i think the average
7,on to talk about
7,the current population survey
7,that we do not
7,side of the equation
7,doing the right thing
7,you would have had
7,that they should be
7,think what you are
7,the american economic association
7,going to go in
7,to some extent but
7,you are exactly right
7,that we talked about
7,be very good at
7,but i find it
7,what is the impact
7,but lets go back
7,the government can do
7,be able to tell
7,are two ways to
7,take care of themselves
7,so it would be
7,that had to be
7,you go into a
7,said that i think
7,lot of work on
7,much more important than
7,the top 1 or
7,of the problem and
7,those of you listening
7,but what happens is
7,is this idea that
7,but its not that
7,top of that you
7,in the past in
7,problem is that you
7,but some of the
7,that you cant do
7,monetary policy has been
7,and then on the
7,by the federal government
7,in the middle and
7,which is in the
7,as we know it
7,a very small amount
7,had to go to
7,they need to be
7,to think about these
7,out of the ground
7,i look at my
7,as you and i
7,compare it to the
7,i dont get to
7,talk about that but
7,seems to be very
7,you want to understand
7,i think that in
7,to pay interest on
7,i think its something
7,is that even if
7,all their money back
7,you think thats true
7,to the central bank
7,other end of the
7,ways to deal with
7,what it was and
7,school of economics lse
7,the people who get
7,but youve got to
7,the amount of the
7,got to be some
7,guest yeah this is
7,issues here one is
7,in the amount of
7,and then they can
7,are just not going
7,the things that ive
7,point out is that
7,lot of things going
7,to go into the
7,didnt have to be
7,that you might have
7,we are living in
7,tell me what you
7,the product of the
7,guest yeah i have
7,need a lot of
7,the book which i
7,what you are suggesting
7,im just saying that
7,only a few people
7,need to get the
7,end up with is
7,a set of rules
7,we can do to
7,back and talk about
7,i grew up in
7,question is whether the
7,have a problem with
7,what will happen is
7,to do the best
7,which is how do
7,would be good for
7,youve got to make
7,are interested in the
7,what would have been
7,guest right russ its
7,say i dont think
7,even if there is
7,the consequences of that
7,need to make sure
7,is the size of
7,some of the more
7,and so they would
7,to get a job
7,and a few other
7,is where i think
7,so i think this
7,growth in nominal gdp
7,same time i think
7,the federal government in
7,its not enough to
7,that ought to be
7,want to go into
7,back of the store
7,end of the 19th
7,put more money into
7,and at that point
7,so i dont see
7,look like they are
7,thats because they are
7,we have to give
7,we are back to
7,were going to move
7,just to make sure
7,more and more of
7,and then we are
7,in and year out
7,where its going to
7,of all kinds of
7,which i think has
7,that i think there
7,may be a little
7,because i thought it
7,cause of the crisis
7,so we are not
7,great deal of money
7,i want them to
7,that people who have
7,its a mistake to
7,increase in the price
7,those who want to
7,i think they have
7,guest yeah thats a
7,of the banks and
7,people are talking about
7,about how to make
7,of view of the
7,to come to grips
7,what might be done
7,and the reason why
7,easy it is to
7,the book there are
7,you give them a
7,the other hand the
7,thats right and i
7,and thats exactly what
7,and some of that
7,people who like to
7,put your finger on
7,you know in the
7,the job of the
7,was a great deal
7,what that is and
7,we have to recognize
7,in a very small
7,out whats going on
7,to do with these
7,not sure what the
7,go to the doctor
7,effect on the economy
7,you are arguing that
7,which of course is
7,russ your book is
7,it would be more
7,the efficient market hypothesis
7,for a minute and
7,it should have been
7,that didnt work out
7,you get out of
7,is the difference between
7,in recent years and
7,than they were in
7,we have a pretty
7,think there is something
7,for the purpose of
7,there are parts of
7,can go back and
7,is that they have
7,have to face the
7,may not be as
7,that will lead to
7,i talk about the
7,to spend the money
7,the former soviet union
7,what to do and
7,it is if you
7,but i take your
7,and there are all
7,but i think i
7,not just that its
7,going to say that
7,there is a group
7,what are you doing
7,think thats one of
7,anarchy state and utopia
7,going to tell you
7,would be if you
7,of inflation in the
7,and so forth the
7,very aware of the
7,was a bad idea
7,at this point the
7,i was a little
7,to talk about is
7,monetary and fiscal policy
7,of certain kinds of
7,bank of england and
7,so far is that
7,had the opportunity to
7,a threat to the
7,this would be the
7,whats the evidence for
7,the complexity of the
7,have a kind of
7,the creditors of bear
7,its a bad idea
7,its going to make
7,all of these different
7,on the shoulders of
7,by looking at the
7,was struck by how
7,of the importance of
7,the more you have
7,that would be good
7,to get it from
7,in the size of
7,i wrote a book
7,of the status quo
7,being able to do
7,is you are not
7,in a poor country
7,that there are other
7,a long way to
7,some parts of the
7,i could go on
7,the state of california
7,got out of the
7,the average person has
7,a consequence of the
7,we used to have
7,that they will be
7,i think that they
7,going to give them
7,spend more time with
7,were going to run
7,because i wanted to
7,i dont like the
7,because they dont know
7,to stay in school
7,of the immune system
7,do it that way
7,the individual and the
7,even though its not
7,you are saying the
7,of all the things
7,other things as well
7,quarter of a percent
7,i dont know exactly
7,he was able to
7,lot of time in
7,it as something that
7,on top of the
7,we wont be able
7,the quality of our
7,what happens is you
7,that leads to a
7,a limited amount of
7,have to come up
7,have been much more
7,i have to have
7,because i think we
7,not be allowed to
7,your thoughts on the
7,to come from the
7,all we have to
7,a new way of
7,played a role in
7,the argument that the
7,going to come out
7,you are saying i
7,way of doing it
7,take a bunch of
7,growth of the economy
7,whats going on guest
7,is a very difficult
7,a big difference between
7,so thats why i
7,to do with how
7,might not have been
7,that the goal of
7,now in the united
7,be put in place
7,what they need to
7,once you do that
7,that the government is
7,you talk about how
7,reserve bank of new
7,to make more money
7,you point out you
7,competing with each other
7,a lot of progress
7,that you can make
7,people who are interested
7,so many of these
7,are not part of
7,dont seem to have
7,of course is the
7,is that we need
7,that for a long
7,guest yeah and so
7,to be at the
7,to come to an
7,the proportion of people
7,we cant do that
7,most of the world
7,point is that we
7,lot of ways to
7,but then when you
7,why dont you just
7,national bureau of economic
7,take it for granted
7,give the example of
7,on the books of
7,united states on the
7,a wide variety of
7,i never thought about
7,to all kinds of
7,ill give you an
7,there had been a
7,russ i have to
7,and thats where the
7,its supposed to be
7,i thought i was
7,you are getting a
7,as they can and
7,at the library of
7,access to health care
7,so even if you
7,to do in order
7,how do you measure
7,there are plenty of
7,cant just look at
7,that what we are
7,many of these things
7,to try to create
7,is that the fed
7,you see this in
7,what seems to be
7,going to read a
7,you know a lot
7,but its kind of
7,increase the size of
7,a function of the
7,us in terms of
7,in the last 50
7,in which people are
7,but i would argue
7,that will be a
7,guest yes it is
7,the way that it
7,them and they are
7,that means that the
7,to the federal reserve
7,but in fact its
7,id be interested in
7,there was an increase
7,when you have the
7,the first is that
7,you had to get
7,is part of our
7,i think its more
7,its a little hard
7,when i first started
7,if i understand it
7,created a lot of
7,rate of return on
7,at the fed and
7,the open science framework
7,was viewed as a
7,millions and millions of
7,the stock market crash
7,go on and on
7,two and a half
7,the political system is
7,i was working on
7,because i think most
7,then you are not
7,the next generation of
7,now lets talk about
7,not what we are
7,another way of saying
7,and i think your
7,were not allowed to
7,that we all have
7,see a lot more
7,insurance corporation improvement act
7,to tell you what
7,they are really good
7,figure out how it
7,rest of the country
7,and the same thing
7,say that you are
7,that the demand for
7,my point of view
7,rule of law is
7,the council of economic
7,that seems like a
7,the front page of
7,is it true that
7,partly because they are
7,you cant get a
7,whats wrong with the
7,just that they are
7,i think its hard
7,let me put it
7,the political process and
7,you want to add
7,you know something about
7,how can that be
7,okay im going to
7,of course you cant
7,the money supply the
7,so where do you
7,ask it a different
7,thats right russ and
7,got to be a
7,national football league nfl
7,so what do we
7,say im going to
7,you get into the
7,the rate of interest
7,do you need to
7,and so you get
7,and then when the
7,we get to a
7,no matter how many
7,i think you should
7,or may not be
7,of the cost of
7,its way through the
7,so were going to
7,when i talk to
7,you can make the
7,ways of thinking about
7,was an increase in
7,course one of the
7,you dont care about
7,is there is no
7,back to adam smith
7,you go out and
7,i guess the question
7,because it was so
7,organization for economic cooperation
7,of these kind of
7,need to be able
7,as high as it
7,the mortgage interest deduction
7,the idea here is
7,the right people in
7,40 or 50 years
7,couple of weeks ago
7,means you have to
7,me put it this
7,some of this stuff
7,they cant do it
7,i think if we
7,for the benefit of
7,lets turn to that
7,so what kind of
7,interesting to see how
7,i think it also
7,they are not always
7,never going to be
7,that period of time
7,they tend to have
7,what can be done
7,the federal reserve which
7,we have to think
7,the problem was that
7,is that its an
7,i think about the
7,spend more money on
7,is the way that
7,a little bit guest
7,dont really know how
7,eggs in one basket
7,the economy in a
7,about what they are
7,then im going to
7,we didnt have to
7,lot of other things
7,i dont really know
7,when they talk about
7,well in terms of
7,that its just a
7,size of the market
7,the best i can
7,up and down the
7,it hard to get
7,a country with a
7,dont have to give
7,quite the same as
7,of what government does
7,the 18th century and
7,people who won the
7,the future and the
7,so that was the
7,i dont know and
7,on the question of
7,people when they are
7,you think is the
7,under a gold standard
7,to do and the
7,give in the book
7,but in any case
7,on the hook for
7,of growth of the
7,have a system that
7,you use the word
7,the world we have
7,are going to move
7,thing to think about
7,of a heart attack
7,things that i think
7,people who are really
7,russ so whats the
7,some of the work
7,theyll be able to
7,to get a handle
7,problem the problem is
7,people are able to
7,what happened is that
7,if we can find
7,like to think about
7,10 or 15 years
7,and causes of the
7,i also think that
7,a few weeks ago
7,try to make it
7,and over again and
7,in their ability to
7,going to get better
7,but were going to
7,or 30 years ago
7,one of the worst
7,solution to the problem
7,want to say something
7,i think about what
7,well and i think
7,people who are already
7,in the mortgage market
7,how difficult it is
7,in the business world
7,this kind of thing
7,as if there were
7,you have to recognize
7,going to come up
7,they are not just
7,that have to be
7,to be a problem
7,on the demand side
7,it was on the
7,dont have to think
7,but before we do
7,world is going to
7,there is a whole
7,that are kind of
7,about it but i
7,i think thats absolutely
7,the things that make
7,have some kind of
7,what it used to
7,they are making a
7,do it is to
7,he won the nobel
7,are going to fall
7,the way that people
7,in lots of ways
7,russ but of course
7,that does seem to
7,corporation improvement act fdicia
7,the united states with
7,work out that way
7,go back and read
7,if you really want
7,is the lack of
7,what would happen to
7,are people who have
7,is an important part
7,thats going to happen
7,so you are suggesting
7,you want to start
7,well there are a
7,to allow people to
7,not enough to go
7,in this country and
7,going to have some
7,about it a lot
7,about the same time
7,that comes to mind
7,will give you a
7,tend to think that
7,high rates of interest
7,get us out of
7,it may be the
7,i was in the
7,made in the past
7,to write a book
7,chief executive officer ceo
7,lot of young people
7,the bulk of the
7,what i was saying
7,explain what you mean
7,at a price that
7,because we are not
7,well if you are
7,the reason we are
7,the reason that we
7,the great depression we
7,by a lot of
7,didnt used to be
7,where most of the
7,other thought i had
7,at u of chicago
7,of the lessons of
7,that came up in
7,and i believe that
7,that you talk about
7,go back to work
7,heres what i think
7,the fact that some
7,is whether or not
7,the money supply to
7,guest well it is
7,your reaction to it
7,you know they are
7,do you see as
7,and you see the
7,what you find is
7,but i dont see
7,that some of that
7,what you and i
7,exactly what it is
7,is a good example
7,work a lot of
7,the government should be
7,and of course that
7,about that guest well
7,you take away the
7,and exchange commission sec
7,and then they would
7,and the second is
7,russ right guest so
7,cant get out of
7,a lot of room
7,be able to find
7,why is it so
7,that we live in
7,its hard to say
7,a lot more about
7,the opposite of the
7,standard argument is that
7,true in the united
7,step back and say
7,guest exactly so the
7,going to say it
7,to those of us
7,the world which is
7,for people to do
7,as well as a
7,in one of those
7,to put together a
7,talked about it in
7,a good thing and
7,terms of trying to
7,a signal to the
7,the first time in
7,and you see this
7,are not on the
7,about it is the
7,and how they are
7,is first of all
7,sustainable specialization and trade
7,is a huge part
7,im not quite sure
7,is going to lead
7,back to this question
7,the nature and causes
7,do you mean we
7,that you get a
7,of sustainable specialization and
7,reduce the probability of
7,to get a loan
7,is that it doesnt
7,what they are trying
7,lot of money in
7,said this is a
7,quite a bit in
7,when you see the
7,i dont think people
7,but i think for
7,and i find that
7,at the macro level
7,it looks like a
7,you look at your
7,he would have been
7,the notion that you
7,whats going on russ
7,and that if you
7,the journal of economic
7,has been going on
7,is that some of
7,federal home loan bank
7,what would you have
7,to have an effect
7,our topic today is
7,how much money they
7,that can be done
7,time a lot of
7,but it was the
7,you know i dont
7,at about the same
7,in order to keep
7,they dont like it
7,the way the fed
7,on the role of
7,going to disagree with
7,was sort of a
7,was supposed to do
7,and come up with
7,which is that it
7,at a very low
7,youve got to go
7,so you look at
7,about this a lot
7,he was kind of
7,the same time they
7,true and i think
7,talk about that for
7,and this is all
7,than that i think
7,have in the united
7,dont know that they
7,to see if it
7,the gold standard the
7,and as soon as
7,a little more optimistic
7,other people in the
7,guest yeah it is
7,has a lot to
7,would be the equivalent
7,is going to cause
7,reason to believe that
7,im not a big
7,sympathetic to the idea
7,are a little more
7,what appears to be
7,was a bit of
7,that it might be
7,at the last minute
7,in the banking system
7,figure out how much
7,about it is its
7,in some ways its
7,do you get to
7,the limits of our
7,so it could be
7,were just talking about
7,as you say it
7,that the reason that
7,what were talking about
7,have to take that
7,move on to a
7,that in a minute
7,they do a lot
7,get back to your
7,but what about the
7,dont need to worry
7,made it harder for
7,for the fed to
7,dont want to see
7,out of the blue
7,we know about that
7,that all of these
7,is a very powerful
7,in the past the
7,and how did they
7,and i think people
7,want to take the
7,was a way to
7,you can debate whether
7,to say i dont
7,are going to need
7,to this issue of
7,we are stuck with
7,and thats what you
7,want to move on
7,due to the fact
7,are not thinking about
7,be able to understand
7,people who try to
7,they could have done
7,a couple of decades
7,if the government is
7,makes a big difference
7,of the federal government
7,that i wanted to
7,there used to be
7,figure out what to
7,what it says is
7,the 20th century in
7,to the value of
7,so we have this
7,way in which you
7,about the kind of
7,but it doesnt seem
7,there had been no
7,came out in the
7,of the price system
7,the limits of reason
7,and so on that
7,about the quality of
7,the denationalization of money
7,it they are not
7,it forces you to
7,then youve got to
7,but it is true
7,would be that the
7,national institute of health
7,if you are willing
7,in the following sense
7,and it would have
7,to me is the
7,it turns out there
7,to tell them what
7,theres not going to
7,over the world and
7,so i want you
7,want to start by
7,should be trying to
7,thats sort of the
7,me go back to
7,hard for us to
7,a lot of public
7,a lot of its
7,make much of a
7,is if you look
7,talk about that guest
7,i think weve got
7,get the most out
7,to me there are
7,as you say a
7,and you get to
7,dont want to buy
7,coming to an end
7,we ought to have
7,i am talking about
7,which is not the
7,does the united states
7,but because of the
7,might have been a
7,to have to go
7,theres a great deal
7,monetary policy is ineffective
7,20 shillings a bushel
7,over the last decade
7,are willing to do
7,to my mind is
7,russ im not sure
7,maybe a little bit
7,people look at the
7,money market mutual funds
7,going to be higher
7,the other side would
7,years in a row
7,of changes in the
7,you need to go
7,are saying that the
7,i think was a
7,you didnt have to
7,i think that theres
7,talk about what we
7,could be a lot
7,kind of thing you
7,in many ways the
7,we want to live
7,a lot of value
7,had an incentive to
7,dont even know what
7,have to have some
7,have a very different
7,with a great deal
7,i think is that
7,have to be in
7,we talked about in
7,going to be as
7,that bear stearns was
7,of law and economics
7,has the right to
7,but by and large
7,get your reaction to
7,and the other one
7,russ and when you
7,that there are two
7,i think its because
7,by the government or
7,for a period of
7,that in the long
7,to ask you one
7,not as good at
7,we need to spend
7,a long time in
7,the other way and
7,is that correct yes
7,back and forth between
7,have been talking about
7,about it there are
7,long it takes to
7,you think we ought
7,that many of these
7,and we have an
7,the point i want
7,is as you say
7,going to use it
7,the fact that that
7,last part of the
7,they have their own
7,is more or less
7,there are many different
7,i dont know its
7,on i want to
7,of a sudden people
7,the reason we have
7,of people who would
7,in the 1930s and
7,is that most people
7,look at what the
7,up with a very
7,you wouldnt have to
7,of that guest i
7,about what that means
7,they spend a lot
7,its worse than that
7,right now we have
7,of stuff in the
7,the bottom line of
7,my wife and i
7,have been a good
7,to look at that
7,an infinite number of
7,the wrong way to
7,of this is that
7,very small number of
7,too much of a
7,come to grips with
7,might be a good
7,and well talk about
7,so what would you
7,we do about it
7,the fault of the
7,why would i want
7,now if you are
7,would not be a
7,the part i find
7,when i went to
7,as long as there
7,he was interested in
7,in a position of
7,a chance to do
7,you dont know that
7,spend other peoples money
7,more than it takes
7,of it went to
7,you can get it
7,to communicate with each
7,some point in the
7,we dont know about
7,not going to let
7,going to do about
7,if you do that
7,in the standard of
7,that there could be
7,going to be people
7,in which you can
7,of the general theory
7,up to a point
7,dont think of it
7,think about this is
7,the interest rate on
7,or is it just
7,from being able to
7,it how do you
7,the fed should be
7,do we get to
7,look at some of
7,that but if you
7,have a much more
7,of the book was
7,in the book there
7,you think about how
7,they have to have
7,the structure of the
7,guest thats a good
7,it was kind of
7,are going to become
7,out what are the
7,get into a good
7,point out there are
7,the greater good rationalization
7,you looked at the
7,and of course he
7,you could make a
7,back to your earlier
7,the same thing about
7,dont pay attention to
7,we have all these
7,dont look at the
7,the role of money
7,it wasnt so much
7,a lot of pressure
7,to keep up with
7,would have happened if
7,that people are not
7,answer to that is
7,at whats going on
7,i dont see it
7,people who wanted to
7,money to people who
7,the same as a
7,when i think of
7,may not have been
7,to walk away from
6,russ correct guest and
6,that there are so
6,at the same rate
6,and so it is
6,that the central bank
6,and what i think
6,amount of money that
6,think you can do
6,early on in the
6,you are doing the
6,you can buy a
6,talk about what they
6,lets talk about those
6,why i am not
6,the repeal of the
6,i do agree with
6,to one of these
6,again going back to
6,part of what makes
6,is not allowed to
6,one way to get
6,i think you know
6,the impact of one
6,best i can do
6,talking about is the
6,worry about that but
6,in a world without
6,it was at the
6,to ask you to
6,if not all of
6,we have plenty of
6,in the nature of
6,we were in the
6,to say this is
6,take the job that
6,at some point you
6,just dont have the
6,do think there are
6,i think in fact
6,so when we say
6,come up with some
6,im trying to get
6,hard to measure but
6,certain amount of money
6,to be very very
6,as you get older
6,more than a billion
6,what would be a
6,you had a lot
6,and its not very
6,i dont understand that
6,is probably the most
6,beginning of the 20th
6,on wall street and
6,in the divorce rate
6,in some sense you
6,what it is in
6,how could it be
6,we take for granted
6,on the ground and
6,would have been better
6,the number of workers
6,of the public school
6,of the economy to
6,guest yeah exactly russ
6,little bit out of
6,that correct guest thats
6,think the thing that
6,in the bottom quintile
6,the way that i
6,you do that you
6,and all sorts of
6,going to be another
6,we think that the
6,weve got to do
6,in the last couple
6,because you are going
6,a sense of how
6,they dont seem to
6,i think has been
6,against each other and
6,more often than not
6,the next 10 years
6,that if you put
6,let me push back
6,not the best way
6,in the world they
6,people who have to
6,go back to a
6,and what we are
6,a long time for
6,those of you out
6,which is not what
6,in the 1980s when
6,think thats the way
6,the pure theory of
6,as we go forward
6,it we dont have
6,i think thats probably
6,the power to regulate
6,know one of the
6,the ones that have
6,you a question about
6,i think i was
6,so if you go
6,get access to the
6,saying i dont know
6,you dont see the
6,have a stake in
6,reduced the amount of
6,the minimum wage is
6,the right thing and
6,what you get is
6,going to give up
6,and the same is
6,be able to sell
6,in the paper you
6,right i think thats
6,guest well thats a
6,we are at the
6,millions of dollars in
6,are going to let
6,ask you about one
6,i just wanted to
6,a very good point
6,a way i think
6,a question of what
6,talked about this in
6,million dollars worth of
6,if the value of
6,i have no doubt
6,of what i think
6,want to make is
6,of these people who
6,it was a period
6,the great depression as
6,different from the way
6,and in my view
6,in a state of
6,15 or 20 years
6,is not something you
6,of them in the
6,a little bit out
6,about what happened in
6,and they dont have
6,the things that the
6,and so on in
6,thats a pretty good
6,going to be harder
6,want to say one
6,treatise on the family
6,you can get out
6,more likely it is
6,have to be more
6,in the first part
6,russ so do you
6,the world we are
6,willing to work for
6,you deal with that
6,trying to find a
6,at the right time
6,in a sort of
6,we go to the
6,you could argue thats
6,which seems like a
6,i look at that
6,going back to your
6,what i try to
6,for people at the
6,so many people are
6,to deal with these
6,to be kind of
6,them in a way
6,they are used to
6,took a long time
6,try to find out
6,the rate of increase
6,things the government does
6,or at least the
6,to the supreme court
6,well i want to
6,time in the future
6,are lots of ways
6,could have done that
6,agree with you guest
6,you could say that
6,they otherwise would be
6,get more and more
6,i should point out
6,thats why you have
6,the wisdom of the
6,a long time there
6,then you have a
6,they are doing the
6,is a question of
6,so this is not
6,been talking about the
6,and now we have
6,russ you are talking
6,we are starting to
6,a pawn of the
6,let me come back
6,dont think this is
6,the rate of return
6,i said to you
6,into a lot of
6,to do the kind
6,role for the state
6,think its true that
6,it can be done
6,to think about and
6,i would have said
6,they are doing a
6,a long time that
6,that if there is
6,that we have an
6,do you do that
6,and we have this
6,been a guest on
6,think this is what
6,can think of it
6,but to say that
6,if you give me
6,the same time you
6,two years after the
6,is i think that
6,do it in the
6,we should have a
6,seems to be true
6,the puzzle is why
6,now all of a
6,i dont mean to
6,you cant do it
6,have any interest in
6,people who would like
6,for them to do
6,and i said you
6,part of the increase
6,this is a way
6,before we talk about
6,who pays for it
6,which is a good
6,trying to think about
6,i would have been
6,is in fact a
6,said it was a
6,one is that it
6,it in the form
6,that we dont really
6,and in that case
6,just a few years
6,as the head of
6,not going to put
6,in the constitution of
6,it makes a lot
6,ill tell you why
6,did not have the
6,of the same country
6,inquiry into the nature
6,guest well i guess
6,guest well its a
6,the other reason is
6,yourself and you are
6,because when you look
6,one thing i think
6,at the market price
6,to know whats going
6,be better off with
6,financial crisis in the
6,or you have to
6,are going to the
6,in response to that
6,that in fact the
6,to do this is
6,and of course theres
6,by the way im
6,to be more aggressive
6,why dont we start
6,well its hard to
6,the monetary and financial
6,you spend a lot
6,which is what a
6,was a period of
6,of course you know
6,to the price of
6,the book is a
6,rest of your life
6,couple of things i
6,part of that story
6,in the past i
6,going to move on
6,try to tease out
6,we can go into
6,in a market system
6,making it easier for
6,is the evidence that
6,if you dont pay
6,of the effect of
6,it would be interesting
6,theres a set of
6,about what would happen
6,guest yeah russ its
6,a part of me
6,so going back to
6,in the second half
6,fraction of the population
6,go up and down
6,i think one thing
6,vast majority of our
6,seems to me they
6,to the financial crisis
6,at the back of
6,the root of the
6,part of it i
6,the example of a
6,need to know about
6,in the book its
6,this is the kind
6,for people to think
6,on the wrong side
6,and of course as
6,have a way to
6,something you want to
6,a different way and
6,is that we can
6,make it clear that
6,we can have a
6,an enormous increase in
6,would go to the
6,to that would be
6,what id like to
6,about the idea that
6,people who are at
6,talk about it but
6,the world of the
6,was going to ask
6,teach them how to
6,figure out ways to
6,trying to make sure
6,do you think he
6,then well talk about
6,were some of the
6,to be based on
6,not a question of
6,for a few years
6,that we are trying
6,that is exactly the
6,and again this is
6,not so good at
6,able to have a
6,trying to look at
6,what it means is
6,but you are going
6,that the value of
6,willing to take a
6,was trying to get
6,where you want to
6,in the democratic party
6,selfsufficiency is the road
6,book you talk about
6,but if they dont
6,so im a little
6,it is the case
6,think we could do
6,two issues here one
6,the road to poverty
6,done in the past
6,they had to have
6,used to be able
6,russ well i agree
6,on the road to
6,and you know what
6,fact that people are
6,about it as a
6,so to me the
6,and thats the problem
6,they did was they
6,all over the country
6,of that is going
6,is very difficult to
6,the problem is not
6,and you know you
6,increase in the divorce
6,go out and try
6,it is a problem
6,to be in prison
6,what that means and
6,is when you look
6,to reduce the amount
6,you a little more
6,and the other side
6,have a situation where
6,it is hard to
6,and you go back
6,an invisible hand to
6,so you can get
6,they would be if
6,i know you have
6,they go to the
6,most of human history
6,are a lot more
6,or at least a
6,you look at all
6,the world we live
6,in the republican party
6,lots of people and
6,think of that guest
6,so thats part of
6,so they dont have
6,example one of the
6,no doubt that the
6,we are just going
6,would be one of
6,didnt know how to
6,to start thinking about
6,i view it as
6,lot of sense to
6,russ do we know
6,there are at least
6,at the time people
6,the austrian theory of
6,effect of the stimulus
6,we can get into
6,the case in the
6,at the micro level
6,thats right russ so
6,and you had to
6,standard of living for
6,very very long time
6,and a half to
6,to be the first
6,but you are suggesting
6,supposed to be doing
6,i think people who
6,theory of the business
6,over that time period
6,right guest thats right
6,i always think of
6,manipulation of money and
6,the person who has
6,use the price system
6,of them they are
6,think there is an
6,what works and what
6,does that leave us
6,of large financial institutions
6,need a little bit
6,going to get ahead
6,time and i think
6,you have lots of
6,right kind of nothing
6,your life if you
6,something else going on
6,the one who is
6,the way it would
6,its going to do
6,lot of money from
6,health care is not
6,is a case where
6,a lot about it
6,a lot of unemployed
6,thought of it as
6,it depends on what
6,but dont want to
6,used to be you
6,want to believe that
6,and i think many
6,would have been if
6,and so on there
6,it makes sense to
6,what we might do
6,but it didnt work
6,the ratio of the
6,going to put a
6,as much of a
6,we could think of
6,do whatever they want
6,that we would have
6,a very different way
6,pure theory of capital
6,to do in this
6,so the united states
6,like how do you
6,in the ability of
6,whether you are a
6,the impact of that
6,does raise the question
6,the theory of the
6,of the population that
6,what is true is
6,the point of the
6,which means that the
6,feel like you are
6,today than it was
6,the next ten years
6,but theres a lot
6,youve got to pay
6,to do with their
6,argument is that we
6,i think of as
6,would be true of
6,it takes a long
6,to go around and
6,and i tend to
6,my argument is that
6,people who go to
6,a lot of women
6,that monetary policy was
6,guest thats correct russ
6,the risk of the
6,he looks at the
6,it is possible to
6,this comes back to
6,so there is no
6,in our ability to
6,the other people who
6,can do whatever you
6,because those are the
6,that we are still
6,do very well in
6,hard to distinguish between
6,was that there was
6,where we are going
6,your thoughts on how
6,not have a lot
6,they have to get
6,theres nothing wrong with
6,which is that we
6,here and i think
6,whole bunch of different
6,ask you a different
6,that you can get
6,an idea of what
6,do with it and
6,is that in order
6,and then i think
6,of the problem if
6,at this point but
6,better off if we
6,view of human nature
6,at that point i
6,that all of the
6,to the keynesian model
6,right one of the
6,in standard of living
6,youve been talking about
6,is where we have
6,if they do that
6,and more people are
6,do they do that
6,take care of them
6,so what is the
6,point is that the
6,would be better if
6,of course we dont
6,we are better off
6,its a waste of
6,is the essence of
6,because that was the
6,will come in and
6,about what we know
6,to make sure it
6,what its like to
6,think about this and
6,to talk about why
6,part of the challenge
6,a long time they
6,to be true and
6,there is something to
6,what its going to
6,as a source of
6,they tend not to
6,send me an email
6,im just trying to
6,there is a strong
6,also a lot of
6,make sure that it
6,know i dont think
6,trying to make it
6,goes to the cause
6,with one another and
6,instead of having to
6,you dont know which
6,number of things that
6,when you are a
6,the money market mutual
6,out there is a
6,so what did you
6,in the 21st century
6,people who are very
6,2013 russ were going
6,russ thats a great
6,he said this is
6,and i think weve
6,russ okay guest so
6,im not saying its
6,that it had to
6,that when people are
6,how the economy is
6,has to be the
6,the goal of life
6,so long as the
6,certainly true that the
6,but the one thing
6,it because its a
6,get out of that
6,what the answer is
6,taking advantage of the
6,we have a whole
6,try to create a
6,the government in the
6,it takes a while
6,what i did was
6,in a world that
6,a way of organizing
6,are going to continue
6,there are ways to
6,the problem of course
6,you talk about a
6,the federal government the
6,there is a little
6,do that and i
6,everybody else in the
6,there are a thousand
6,russ its true guest
6,of this i think
6,guest thats right its
6,never thought about it
6,because i think it
6,that if you can
6,so much more than
6,but there are many
6,back to my earlier
6,is a very small
6,be the ones who
6,we need to understand
6,why is that so
6,i think its also
6,and you know i
6,is a problem in
6,are in charge of
6,we have to put
6,of all this is
6,it for granted that
6,it for more than
6,because the cost of
6,are really saying is
6,have to get to
6,is a bad idea
6,had a number of
6,the welfare of the
6,lot of things we
6,we dont understand the
6,of them will be
6,when you want to
6,the book but i
6,going to be important
6,years ago we were
6,i would just add
6,and then once you
6,there must be some
6,hard to argue that
6,point is that you
6,i think for the
6,want to know is
6,jp morgan chase to
6,we are right now
6,if i look at
6,them so i think
6,that it may be
6,actually a lot of
6,of people want to
6,are still in the
6,try to find a
6,it is such a
6,that is what is
6,there are hundreds of
6,what we do and
6,and he says that
6,from all over the
6,the other side and
6,say there is a
6,so the point is
6,aside for the moment
6,thats what they do
6,the story is that
6,at that point and
6,are doing the same
6,it doesnt work out
6,is going to solve
6,a race to the
6,i dont understand it
6,wouldnt have been a
6,lets get to the
6,but not all of
6,the countries that have
6,so why is it
6,so it may be
6,we have to use
6,point is that its
6,guest i think so
6,has anything to do
6,are very aware of
6,to worry about getting
6,no its not a
6,in the velocity of
6,much to do with
6,would have been worse
6,in the current system
6,when bear stearns was
6,im trying to make
6,it is a good
6,had been allowed to
6,as in the united
6,the way they did
6,that i think if
6,to make a distinction
6,thing to do and
6,the government as a
6,have a group of
6,dont have the same
6,that the amount of
6,university in st louis
6,when you have to
6,really going to be
6,how are you going
6,and the lack of
6,the more important point
6,thats where i think
6,to pay a little
6,we do need to
6,will be much more
6,to a great extent
6,this because i think
6,so thats kind of
6,i think i have
6,and when you talk
6,much more than that
6,it if you look
6,people dont like the
6,you and i might
6,to the rate of
6,2014 russ our topic
6,what did you find
6,my book is that
6,have a really good
6,idea that you are
6,as i mentioned earlier
6,you are doing a
6,the way there are
6,look at the past
6,in a way we
6,are willing to spend
6,and they were able
6,going to be possible
6,is the way the
6,get something out of
6,one of these people
6,looked at the data
6,that you think is
6,with a little bit
6,we know there are
6,whether they are going
6,can do it in
6,5 or 6 years
6,to do so and
6,dont have as much
6,where one of the
6,when i was younger
6,in the longer run
6,some of these ideas
6,are going to suffer
6,to me and said
6,so there is an
6,thought you were going
6,what would happen is
6,as a result when
6,way to do this
6,way that i think
6,around the fact that
6,look at this and
6,by the way so
6,figure out what it
6,is is there a
6,we dont have enough
6,first of all we
6,and he had a
6,of the game are
6,argument to be made
6,the people involved in
6,know if its true
6,the beauty of the
6,of the government to
6,be done in the
6,we want to get
6,all this stuff and
6,and that is really
6,im willing to pay
6,interesting to think about
6,contraction of the money
6,rule of law and
6,where its hard to
6,role of the fed
6,of which is the
6,able to take advantage
6,going to bail out
6,the impact on the
6,is certainly true that
6,of the reasons people
6,they had to do
6,i think it comes
6,lot of money for
6,the late 1960s and
6,a lot of banks
6,want to hear the
6,then you get a
6,dont want to sell
6,lot of problems with
6,you start to get
6,of the electromagnetic spectrum
6,the thing that is
6,to do anything about
6,on the amount of
6,the book is how
6,same as it was
6,a lot of research
6,then we have to
6,the poor and the
6,close by talking about
6,romney is going to
6,we did a podcast
6,which is a huge
6,with a high school
6,even if you have
6,your book is about
6,and you point out
6,you are saying something
6,had some of the
6,at the time when
6,me give you the
6,turn out so well
6,the more likely it
6,interest rates go up
6,money from the rest
6,wouldnt have been able
6,get the kind of
6,amount of money to
6,going to pay a
6,dont think theres anything
6,the next couple of
6,half of the distribution
6,and we kind of
6,in the bay area
6,in the future is
6,come to believe that
6,a certain type of
6,agree with that the
6,is doing a lot
6,to what we were
6,lower than it was
6,and the idea is
6,aware of the fact
6,happen in the united
6,and i say well
6,didnt have a lot
6,its not that i
6,of the internet and
6,but what do you
6,author of the study
6,you are stuck with
6,as a result that
6,at the state and
6,or if you are
6,the fundamental question is
6,dont want to take
6,if they did it
6,last 30 years is
6,one of these things
6,so thats one thing
6,of there being a
6,the evolution of the
6,the labor force and
6,that if you had
6,than it otherwise would
6,a way that the
6,be able to be
6,a pretty good idea
6,better to have a
6,you also have a
6,more or less the
6,and then you look
6,of the road to
6,make up the difference
6,is the amount of
6,would allow them to
6,at the impact of
6,so all of the
6,from a to b
6,theres a big debate
6,i didnt know that
6,turn of the century
6,what im going to
6,want to buy a
6,its not easy to
6,russ which is a
6,be viewed as a
6,on the board of
6,think you talk about
6,many of them were
6,different groups of people
6,do in terms of
6,us some of the
6,on the topic of
6,trying to understand why
6,so thats why we
6,the right side of
6,it turns out they
6,but most of us
6,the growth rate of
6,the argument would be
6,it was not the
6,this to me is
6,that allows you to
6,the notion that we
6,so i think you
6,there have to be
6,guest its not a
6,so you end up
6,then on the other
6,had to be done
6,balance sheets of banks
6,in some dimension but
6,it youve got to
6,and then at the
6,going to be great
6,i thought you were
6,and i dont mean
6,wrong with that argument
6,you go into the
6,of the us government
6,where there are a
6,united states if you
6,theres a difference between
6,the people i know
6,hear a lot of
6,in the following way
6,thing i think the
6,what are the implications
6,the role of prices
6,let me challenge you
6,point you are making
6,there is more than
6,do x y and
6,its the right thing
6,when you talked about
6,you are free to
6,i think people have
6,guest well of course
6,always a good idea
6,that may be true
6,see if we can
6,how do you go
6,part and parcel of
6,as some kind of
6,make a huge difference
6,in the world what
6,at the very least
6,russ say that again
6,that we need more
6,because its not a
6,the 2008 financial crisis
6,the distribution of income
6,you start looking at
6,it means that you
6,i couldnt agree more
6,increase the demand for
6,people who work at
6,so you dont want
6,a lot on this
6,was in the early
6,thousands and thousands of
6,i knew nothing about
6,very much about the
6,other hand there are
6,say i dont know
6,question is what do
6,what they do and
6,people on wall street
6,i give you a
6,we think of it
6,is an incentive to
6,come out of this
6,a feature not a
6,and trying to get
6,im going to defend
6,the american economics association
6,really care about the
6,the argument in the
6,that some of them
6,so im not going
6,is the study of
6,about the challenges of
6,is not what the
6,dont know how it
6,know that you are
6,its a good question
6,you can tell me
6,the third thing is
6,i happen to think
6,you point out we
6,and this is why
6,have a good sense
6,dont agree with that
6,what they say and
6,to start with and
6,i think its in
6,we dont know but
6,it would be much
6,there in the first
6,idea that we are
6,out to be right
6,now in terms of
6,what was going to
6,that its not that
6,with a couple of
6,fact that we were
6,is that the only
6,the price down to
6,on the program and
6,the financial crisis of
6,but not the whole
6,that was really the
6,it up on the
6,the middle of it
6,put it on the
6,it looks like there
6,the culture of the
6,hard to understand how
6,that people at the
6,on a regular basis
6,in the book to
6,but to me its
6,makes it harder for
6,i make in the
6,im not sure it
6,got to figure out
6,but do you think
6,because thats where the
6,think that people who
6,an effect on the
6,to think that its
6,decline in the velocity
6,is i think its
6,a good thing we
6,you a different question
6,at all in the
6,the last ten years
6,a reference to the
6,and thats a good
6,same kind of thing
6,even though it was
6,and so that was
6,and as i said
6,but it is interesting
6,down the road and
6,argument in favor of
6,think thats the wrong
6,the russian orthodox church
6,of that but i
6,side of the economy
6,theme of the book
6,we want to look
6,that id like to
6,are a thousand things
6,much of it was
6,it was too late
6,it it was a
6,and he said i
6,for them to be
6,and you know the
6,not have the same
6,two of them and
6,part of our lives
6,he doesnt want to
6,the cost of doing
6,the home ownership rate
6,on the financial crisis
6,so thats what we
6,in the spring of
6,is coming from the
6,for this kind of
6,in common which is
6,if youve got a
6,should be in the
6,thats not to say
6,not meant to be
6,which i dont think
6,about the ability of
6,trying to get at
6,the things that happened
6,of the problem but
6,before the great depression
6,doesnt do very well
6,it appears to be
6,way to make money
6,going to move to
6,guest one of the
6,to pay a premium
6,at the time he
6,on any given day
6,what we mean by
6,seems to me and
6,is in the united
6,over and over and
6,a very large number
6,you are really saying
6,up with a lot
6,of the reason for
6,was going to make
6,idea is that the
6,see if i can
6,the last thing i
6,is something called the
6,who want to be
6,idea that if you
6,of that is due
6,because we are a
6,thats not a good
6,of the time they
6,you start thinking about
6,thing you have to
6,on behalf of the
6,and if you know
6,so some of the
6,to make sure i
6,from that kind of
6,than they did before
6,and this was a
6,that is one of
6,what they should be
6,to give them the
6,going to start with
6,much a part of
6,now i want to
6,to see if i
6,there is something about
6,but it has a
6,the other point i
6,look at whats going
6,is when you are
6,interesting about that is
6,the cost of that
6,is no such thing
6,that most people dont
6,that allow them to
6,when you take a
6,not going to take
6,we are all identical
6,it but in the
6,and so he was
6,which is that i
6,is the same thing
6,is what i think
6,look at these things
6,in the south and
6,the community reinvestment act
6,and talk about that
6,but maybe its not
6,that has to happen
6,we dont know exactly
6,the limits of human
6,i think its probably
6,that if you get
6,thats a really important
6,and so you see
6,want to invest in
6,the same level of
6,certain amount of gold
6,and if you go
6,got us out of
6,have in the past
6,can talk about that
6,and if you were
6,and why is that
6,i think the bottom
6,is that the way
6,would say you know
6,with a number of
6,that weve been talking
6,going to be pretty
6,than the value of
6,do we have that
6,how much would you
6,was trying to make
6,is not just the
6,the right amount of
6,paying attention to the
6,in the modern economy
6,its a very very
6,i just dont know
6,but that is not
6,unless you have a
6,the person who was
6,there is some kind
6,have to do a
6,in a few minutes
6,so talk about why
6,it would be hard
6,are the result of
6,and the result is
6,about the meaning of
6,is a very very
6,be able to use
6,we really dont understand
6,would be something like
6,do the best they
6,say you dont know
6,for people who want
6,is the united states
6,a very small group
6,i think the big
6,a little bit when
6,and weve got to
6,to people who have
6,what they are saying
6,me to think about
6,out of the market
6,many different kinds of
6,of the corn laws
6,book which is the
6,i was interested in
6,competition with each other
6,section of the book
6,get a different answer
6,is it imaginable that
6,so there are two
6,see the rise of
6,the labor market that
6,we dont know enough
6,a large group of
6,of the main things
6,to me one of
6,to this question of
6,it but it was
6,the current system is
6,have been on the
6,the incentives of the
6,about a third of
6,just the fact that
6,a position to be
6,are just looking at
6,have a very low
6,mean by that and
6,they dont do it
6,the problem is in
6,you know you have
6,do it again and
6,can make more money
6,the unit of analysis
6,on the other and
6,and i guess the
6,what i said is
6,the sense of the
6,that people tend to
6,we do to make
6,people would want to
6,is not the way
6,dont have to work
6,is because they are
6,thats the whole point
6,need to be doing
6,the reason it was
6,the real problem is
6,you say its a
6,a place where people
6,we dont see that
6,i dont know whats
6,if we think of
6,make a difference in
6,idea that there is
6,well i dont have
6,for today is a
6,in new york and
6,all the time its
6,lets talk about your
6,seems to me there
6,is a lot less
6,last 30 or 40
6,thing if you are
6,about 40 of the
6,when a lot of
6,fact that there is
6,in the past they
6,so there have been
6,lot of people do
6,didnt want to do
6,do you know guest
6,things going on at
6,i have a different
6,its a wonderful life
6,of what goes on
6,in the supply of
6,going to be any
6,dont know i think
6,look at the impact
6,now im going to
6,you are looking for
6,if you are already
6,in other words i
6,i think some people
6,would be interesting to
6,the role of a
6,think some of them
6,the one hand you
6,way to make the
6,there are thousands of
6,and in order to
6,so lets take the
6,and how many people
6,is that we should
6,think we are in
6,some truth to it
6,that but you are
6,make the claim that
6,but this is the
6,going to get there
6,and as i say
6,this goes back to
6,to have a little
6,united states is a
6,to ask you a
6,to make the point
6,of the population and
6,that would make it
6,talking about it in
6,no idea what the
6,think like an economist
6,and the power of
6,the point is its
6,have to pay it
6,years down the road
6,think about it that
6,it was because of
6,so if you had
6,from the great depression
6,if you start with
6,of trying to get
6,the federal reserve fed
6,to respond to the
6,in the last two
6,a hundred years ago
6,extent to which the
6,if you get a
6,who is trying to
6,and so thats the
6,think of that argument
6,that is kind of
6,the united states well
6,if you think the
6,were almost out of
6,so talk about how
6,done a good job
6,the front of the
6,would expect to see
6,to the side the
6,where it was before
6,make sure they are
6,it is a real
6,you live in a
6,of the great things
6,lot of times when
6,is if you dont
6,of the economy at
6,what weve done is
6,that you should be
6,the number of households
6,and i sort of
6,to the next level
6,from the people who
6,to each other but
6,and the creation of
6,not just in terms
6,would seem to me
6,guest well they are
6,the point you are
6,it is a lot
6,the price of a
6,of the future and
6,things first of all
6,of the ones that
6,the long run and
6,we talk about that
6,eat a lot of
6,great if you are
6,and the ability of
6,the life of the
6,back to this issue
6,from the very beginning
6,to talk about your
6,even if it doesnt
6,no ones going to
6,they dont like the
6,exactly the same thing
6,in the past has
6,the economy is not
6,he was in the
6,i was doing this
6,and we are talking
6,want to see it
6,which i think was
6,example of this is
6,the money supply that
6,can do the same
6,try to get the
6,you make in the
6,a lot of questions
6,ways to get to
6,dont mean to suggest
6,used to have a
6,and when you do
6,that was supposed to
6,is a measure of
6,this is a problem
6,between men and women
6,you could say the
6,down the street and
6,to your earlier point
6,its not quite as
6,need to do something
6,no they are not
6,the us government to
6,in the system and
6,and its kind of
6,raises the question of
6,as a result if
6,disagree with that but
6,i think that a
6,and so we dont
6,large amount of money
6,you if you are
6,i dont like it
6,and i kind of
6,that it seems to
6,question as to whether
6,in a long time
6,most of us dont
6,that it has to
6,that supply and demand
6,want to go on
6,and so thats what
6,the effect of that
6,because i think a
6,i want to have
6,i dont think well
6,they are part of
6,so its not like
6,to do what you
6,of the pharmaceutical industry
6,2 or 3 years
6,is the power of
6,that kind of a
6,dont like the idea
6,and i thought it
6,way to solve the
6,to have access to
6,there is a natural
6,think the question is
6,more than a million
6,than the united states
6,it was sort of
6,didnt want to have
6,if it doesnt work
6,the american economic review
6,because we have the
6,its not just about
6,jumping up and down
6,were not talking about
6,in the world to
6,we dont do it
6,united states over the
6,you will get a
6,united states and other
6,make it harder for
6,this is not an
6,a little bit later
6,i have talked about
6,the fed should have
6,would be much more
6,in the world who
6,what you are going
6,of human action but
6,the paradox of thrift
6,if this is a
6,i dont care about
6,think about it there
6,do you deal with
6,dont have a great
6,to do whatever it
6,just a lot more
6,i dont think ive
6,the book i think
6,willing to do it
6,that no one would
6,that i know of
6,they had to pay
6,can think about that
6,of the good life
6,guest and this is
6,it reminds me a
6,things have to be
6,a number of places
6,have enough money to
6,and this would be
6,same thing in the
6,a free banking system
6,the only way that
6,thing about it is
6,i think we do
6,lets say you are
6,want to talk to
6,in a big way
6,by that i mean
6,just a way of
6,a vested interest in
6,kind of hard to
6,he thought it was
6,go back and you
6,i dont even know
6,the economy and that
6,you have to find
6,to that is that
6,they were worried about
6,but as you say
6,is the cause of
6,likely to be in
6,in an effort to
6,i think all of
6,about the implications of
6,before we move on
6,there is no question
6,it would just be
6,to be more skeptical
6,to do this for
6,the sake of others
6,not the way it
6,how a lot of
6,are on the right
6,get rid of a
6,some of the policy
6,that there have been
6,we need a lot
6,done in a way
6,of the most powerful
6,better or for worse
6,some of the ways
6,a bank holding company
6,we dont have time
6,the economy is a
6,i havent looked at
6,guest yeah i dont
6,like to think of
6,if we are all
6,the hall of fame
6,for a year or
6,the question then is
6,had to get a
6,do you do with
6,think that one of
6,trying to do in
6,think of ourselves as
6,but at some point
6,we have any evidence
6,of the late 19th
6,are just trying to
6,of this book which
6,think about it this
6,policy of the fed
6,do the best we
6,part of me says
6,bailed out by the
6,these are the people
6,i think for a
6,to get involved in
6,think theres something to
6,is one of my
6,the way i dont
6,30 years from now
6,is a very different
6,in many of the
6,a small chance of
6,we going to get
6,is still a lot
6,are talking about which
6,all these things that
6,and you do that
6,to go all the
6,from the private sector
6,so much of a
6,the same thing that
6,do a very good
6,in the book he
6,and this is something
6,i dont think were
6,what are the alternatives
6,would be to say
6,do we know that
6,people want to be
6,of many of the
6,over the past few
6,because it seems to
6,state of the world
6,people a lot of
6,that most of us
6,need to go back
6,in this case and
6,of it and i
6,is the way in
6,doesnt last very long
6,some people are better
6,take care of it
6,an impact on the
6,look at how much
6,it was the most
6,a situation where we
6,the united states could
6,you think that has
6,the economy and then
6,you can do whatever
6,an argument for the
6,a great way to
6,there is no such
6,an hour and a
6,to be a better
6,we can think of
6,can take advantage of
6,that we just dont
6,to be concerned about
6,on the flip side
6,want to argue that
6,more than that i
6,to think that we
6,and the things that
6,the time and it
6,on for a long
6,the level of spending
6,focus a lot on
6,think about it as
6,in the last half
6,that they had a
6,be made better off
6,that person is going
6,just to make it
6,in that case the
6,russ our topic today
6,before we get into
6,where you have to
6,to borrow money to
6,which is the way
6,are two kinds of
6,it doesnt have any
6,and he says well
6,and stuff like that
6,in which we can
6,theres no question about
6,is its not a
6,i think if i
6,dont have the right
6,how do you deal
6,going to make an
6,actually a little bit
6,about it and the
6,goes out of business
6,at the time in
6,guest and if you
6,its not like they
6,and now they are
6,the price of everything
6,goal of life is
6,going to get back
6,the way its going
6,now i dont think
6,lot of examples of
6,into the labor force
6,the claim that the
6,the general theory and
6,you do when you
6,point in time and
6,bunch of reasons but
6,the law of large
6,than the kind of
6,is we dont know
6,the repeal of glasssteagall
6,and i realized that
6,its a bit of
6,and he talks about
6,they have a different
6,to believe that there
6,by the way and
6,ways of looking at
6,and when you think
6,has been in the
6,it didnt work and
6,of this is a
6,be in prison or
6,bank of new york
6,we will have a
6,that there is more
6,the same thing i
6,is greater than the
6,the things we have
6,and the reason that
6,individualism true and false
6,and he was a
6,that you have some
6,going to be so
6,to be an economist
6,it was a huge
6,more than we take
6,that in the past
6,they were willing to
6,the national institute of
6,thats a very deep
6,the federal trade commission
6,people over the age
6,that it could be
6,if you believe in
6,idea and i think
6,people to do things
6,a variety of other
6,of things that i
6,talk about that a
6,not in a position
6,that is if you
6,the solvency of the
6,on a number of
6,say theres a lot
6,about it guest yeah
6,he was on the
6,been an increase in
6,want to start a
6,so for example in
6,guest so if you
6,i have no problem
6,in the market and
6,it comes from the
6,there could be some
6,about that talk about
6,and so you dont
6,in high school and
6,want a world where
6,i think is quite
6,bunch of people are
6,it took me a
6,to see if you
6,dont know if youve
6,this is the point
6,want to do a
6,russ and you talk
6,a little more about
6,to get the best
6,the control group and
6,people who care about
6,growth of the money
6,actually look at the
6,they were looking at
6,to any of the
6,when they are in
6,the two of us
6,tell us a little
6,your book is that
6,to do it there
6,as a lender of
6,that they are trying
6,that there should be
6,now i dont know
6,of the problem guest
6,all the time the
6,a lot of states
6,the end of poverty
6,top of the income
6,but the most important
6,give us some of
6,i argue in the
6,so the idea of
6,the onset of the
6,has done a lot
6,if that were true
6,on the great depression
6,we dont care about
6,the financial sector which
6,maybe well come back
6,of the council of
6,weve got a lot
6,big chunk of the
6,its a much more
6,talk about it as
6,many times on this
6,and the price of
6,look at the people
6,that is they are
6,that what you are
6,most of us have
6,put them in a
6,its just going to
6,not one of the
6,we are getting a
6,it im going to
6,making sure that the
6,of the problem of
6,as i say in
6,im trying to do
6,it would not be
6,and i think to
6,in a free society
6,and you are the
6,good but its not
6,dont want to put
6,and there is also
6,have been a little
6,the other issue is
6,that we had to
6,a good life and
6,a lot of studies
6,you and i know
6,what we know is
6,wage and price controls
6,they seem to have
6,of checks and balances
6,dont know enough about
6,the ability to get
6,of course he was
6,of the modern economy
6,and you know its
6,i think thats why
6,the other side the
6,which is as you
6,and see if you
6,in front of them
6,what should be done
6,but let me just
6,there was a little
6,because there are so
6,that we are doing
6,but at that point
6,when we think of
6,what you had to
6,dont think they were
6,a good job in
6,you think it was
6,be a very good
6,have a little more
6,why are there firms
6,the other side is
6,the financial sector but
6,that so i think
6,would have to do
6,economic growth in the
6,you to step aside
6,that that is the
6,bunch of people and
6,was able to get
6,of the republican party
6,think it should be
6,end of the month
6,the world and the
6,had the power to
6,while at the same
6,when he talks about
6,get their hands on
6,better way to say
6,we can come back
6,the money supply as
6,thats not what we
6,that i think people
6,good for the country
6,the point where you
6,it might be the
6,run a trade deficit
6,to this day the
6,how would you know
6,in that sense i
6,then on top of
6,what im interested in
6,i think we ought
6,so lets go back
6,double the money supply
6,even though i dont
6,huge part of the
6,be good for the
6,this but i think
6,and thats not a
6,little bit of an
6,a lot of mistakes
6,to the power of
6,there will be some
6,the last half of
6,in terms of this
6,at the front of
6,what they would have
6,a measure of how
6,i want to let
6,think its just a
6,paper in the journal
6,to be associated with
6,whats the value of
6,on the ground in
6,a matter of fact
6,you want them to
6,when you say that
6,want them to be
6,question is if you
6,if you are at
6,this is a major
6,view it as a
6,id like to know
6,you have any idea
6,in addition to the
6,i can think of
6,role for government in
6,be able to answer
6,you and i think
6,the one thing i
6,the political power of
6,they also have a
6,going to go away
6,think about it if
6,and how do we
6,times in the book
6,as big as it
6,could make a lot
6,and why are they
6,depends on what you
6,up with a way
6,if we try to
6,you dont really care
6,you dont talk about
6,mean they are not
6,you want to eat
6,at that time was
6,this was in the
6,go back to this
6,of the book that
6,have the same problem
6,need to create a
6,to get the most
6,the united states weve
6,the last 60 years
6,to get you to
6,understand what you are
6,theres something to that
6,in the presence of
6,those who are in
6,not because they are
6,to do that russ
6,as part of a
6,i think i think
6,turned out that the
6,of the fascinating things
6,we dont know if
6,in response to a
6,of that is just
6,as a consequence of
6,a money market fund
6,are in competition with
6,it doesnt mean that
6,not a coincidence that
6,about that a little
6,we need to know
6,make up for the
6,at different points in
6,i guess you could
6,so they can be
6,but then i think
6,i would say its
6,going to turn to
6,in the economy is
6,at least at the
6,we would need to
6,that i talk about
6,the way we have
6,which is the one
6,than we take in
6,besides the fact that
6,its an interesting idea
6,well it turns out
6,where we are not
6,time it takes to
6,seem to have a
6,whats happened is that
6,it would be worth
6,have a romance about
6,of which there are
6,the last 30 or
6,is the people who
6,idea that we can
6,are trying to build
6,we have a problem
6,that there were no
6,were going to put
6,at what they do
6,have to change the
6,reflects the fact that
6,into the nature and
6,since the great depression
6,better and better at
6,that whats going on
6,many people who are
6,fed at the time
6,to put you in
6,again and again and
6,thought to be the
6,do you see any
6,to me that if
6,which would be a
6,going to be happy
6,at least on the
6,a world where you
6,one student in the
6,like to believe that
6,so much of it
6,small relative to the
6,explain what that is
6,that a number of
6,under the age of
6,some of the gains
6,a lot of his
6,in a very different
6,a situation where people
6,put on the table
6,think thats a lot
6,and i asked him
6,the nobel prize in
6,they didnt have any
6,the last decade or
6,going back to our
6,and you are a
6,costs and benefits and
6,just go back to
6,borrowed a lot of
6,for some of these
6,that point in time
6,were talking about earlier
6,and to make it
6,lets move to the
6,you walk into a
6,russ talk about the
6,of the size of
6,in a slightly different
6,are trying to measure
6,you also have the
6,making the world a
6,the study of economics
6,dont think that the
6,that for a minute
6,if you have the
6,than the fact that
6,the case that if
6,and how does it
6,out to be not
6,before i do that
6,and in a sense
6,other thing is that
6,is not a very
6,think its very hard
6,the washington dc area
6,but having said that
6,is it hard to
6,cooperation and development oecd
6,the 19th century when
6,though it might be
6,to invest in the
6,a place where we
6,in the future the
6,how much of this
6,you a sense of
6,the world right now
6,guest i think this
6,russ well im not
6,in the field of
6,the way that they
6,that you can be
6,to think that the
6,want to move to
6,the central bank and
6,in the center of
6,do you say that
6,people who are trying
6,is an attempt to
6,of one of these
6,thats one way to
6,not sure thats true
6,other people who are
6,they have to make
6,and the notion of
6,you dont know who
6,want to be part
6,of us who dont
6,ways to think about
6,dont know what is
6,dont know i dont
6,and i would have
6,happening in the united
6,you think are the
6,important to remember that
6,dont really have a
6,they could have been
6,i would think that
6,going to be affected
6,kinds of things and
6,so to the extent
6,want to know the
6,to sell it at
6,the federal home loan
6,that you are trying
6,to add one more
6,and of course this
6,for the long term
6,were one of the
6,take advantage of it
6,that the majority of
6,tend to be more
6,of other things that
6,and then they come
6,one of the many
6,you see that in
6,have an idea of
6,im not talking about
6,the time in the
6,which is a big
6,keep in mind that
6,dont want to pay
6,the basis of the
6,the housing market is
6,its the kind of
6,of the book you
6,see some of the
6,that could be done
6,come to that in
6,what we did was
6,part of the country
6,no i dont think
6,that are out there
6,sort of thing that
6,it and if you
6,you have a choice
6,truck barter and exchange
6,the world and then
6,there really is a
6,of the problems that
6,this is a case
6,and there was no
6,think of that as
6,well give you a
6,the united states who
6,we seem to be
6,to me as a
6,there arent that many
6,were able to get
6,we have lots of
6,is there a way
6,a different part of
6,but i have to
6,we can get a
6,of the problems we
6,more but i think
6,this is a really
6,in the early 1960s
6,is a bad thing
6,say i have a
6,of the idea of
6,that make it hard
6,the boom and bust
6,why i think its
6,and so they have
6,is going to affect
6,that when it comes
6,are still going to
6,looking at the data
6,in the same direction
6,not likely to be
6,and out of the
6,times on this program
6,it was designed to
6,is one that is
6,thousands of people who
6,the moment i think
6,the people in power
6,greater good rationalization problem
6,they want to hear
6,to go in the
6,put a tax on
6,its an interesting thing
6,dont work very well
6,its not because of
6,point is that in
6,was talking about the
6,or things like that
6,the tea party movement
6,plan for the future
6,by the time we
6,of skin in the
6,different points of view
6,these sorts of things
6,is a big part
6,to the government and
6,we might not be
6,in different parts of
6,but you also have
6,it may well be
6,run on the bank
6,to these kind of
6,some of the ideas
6,washington university in st
6,is hard to measure
6,one way to look
6,seem to be doing
6,that might not be
6,have much of a
6,point which i think
6,to pick up the
6,there had to be
6,three or four times
6,all three of those
6,about it and they
6,make decisions based on
6,what you try to
6,have to talk about
6,and whether or not
6,changed over the last
6,state and local level
6,again i want to
6,because you cant really
6,of the fed to
6,a little better than
6,of the economics profession
6,it by the way
6,to have a more
6,i think is interesting
6,all of which are
6,said you know i
6,the first time i
6,and i know you
6,so let me challenge
6,let me just give
6,were going to give
6,a huge portion of
6,and in this case
6,are the people that
6,the old days you
6,way to the top
6,i think theres an
6,that they wanted to
6,not as good as
6,we are much more
6,so thats an example
6,and then you think
6,dont think so i
6,i think the fed
6,before we do that
6,about what kind of
6,to do something else
6,and because of the
6,that they did not
6,there is a reason
6,people who say that
6,of the civil war
6,about this in a
6,to be the next
6,dont want to miss
6,i think the issue
6,and i think those
6,and a half years
6,think that was the
6,that is to say
6,even though you dont
6,do you have anything
6,need as many people
6,russ yeah i know
6,think its a mistake
6,be able to see
6,was not a conservative
6,that the supreme court
6,them a little bit
6,a point where you
6,of bear stearns and
6,going to push back
6,the difference between a
6,of course i dont
6,this is what they
6,the way you are
6,it a lot harder
6,in a society where
6,the chief executive officer
6,are still a lot
6,the themes of the
6,is it the case
6,get the economy going
6,a lot to say
6,in the 17th century
6,in theory you could
6,to buy and sell
6,has been able to
6,would be if we
6,not all of them
6,in the next few
6,in silicon valley and
6,because its kind of
6,a run on the
6,reminds me of a
6,were going to let
6,should be looking at
6,going to work and
6,how do you reconcile
6,lot of what i
6,there were so many
6,the great depression but
6,push back on that
6,to do it for
6,at the history of
6,this point in the
6,do that and you
6,its not an easy
6,because first of all
6,about this kind of
6,of the people are
6,the other thing thats
6,and i think some
6,the u of washington
6,and how much is
6,getting back to the
6,at the bottom and
6,in the millennium villages
6,it would be an
6,didnt seem to be
6,people who are making
6,im not in favor
6,about what happens to
6,there are two kinds
6,said a minute ago
6,whats going on at
6,which is that if
6,to get a sense
6,wouldnt it be better
6,time to be alive
6,the proper role of
6,able to get a
6,but what you are
6,is much higher than
6,dont think it is
6,say one of the
6,that as you say
6,like the way the
6,be able to buy
6,as a human being
6,in the future that
6,a dollar a day
6,in a way the
6,and in particular the
6,the federal reserve is
6,united states and you
6,a bunch of reasons
6,think its hard to
6,large group of people
6,that was going on
6,but the idea is
6,of the 21st century
6,before we get started
6,in march of 2008
6,is not something that
6,russ you want to
6,and they found that
6,who were in the
6,its also true that
6,that is not what
6,may be that the
6,same amount of money
6,what we now call
6,the market in a
6,on this program about
6,in the health care
6,that the money supply
6,going to challenge you
6,that cant go on
6,in this case the
6,and the way the
6,it turns out its
6,is something of a
6,about that in the
6,that if you go
6,the state and the
6,the problem is we
6,that in many ways
6,lets get back to
6,in a place like
6,do what you want
6,and the united kingdom
6,of their assets in
6,we have no idea
6,is that the best
6,a good use of
6,now there are many
6,dont think its an
6,in the modern era
6,some of the best
6,much as you want
6,in the near future
6,of those things that
6,we have such a
6,at some point it
6,dont have any interest
6,are the most important
6,about this and i
6,on a casebycase basis
6,going to deal with
5,im going to look
5,a short period of
5,where the government is
5,to go back into
5,and then they have
5,going to argue that
5,guest yeah russ and
5,also true that if
5,it and thats what
5,of the affordable care
5,about what we are
5,there is always a
5,something i want to
5,at the time there
5,i wanted to ask
5,if somebody wants to
5,russ you have a
5,i try not to
5,is you dont have
5,im a fan of
5,more people want to
5,to get stuff done
5,did they do that
5,is that if i
5,at the big picture
5,we know thats not
5,and so youve got
5,a very specific way
5,the local service sector
5,if there is not
5,the same way we
5,the way people think
5,what have you learned
5,the world bank and
5,that kind of change
5,but its not very
5,if i wanted to
5,to see what was
5,the con out of
5,or is it the
5,the form of lower
5,in the middle ages
5,the money they were
5,trying to measure the
5,much more difficult to
5,second thing is that
5,and thats why they
5,problem of course is
5,put money into the
5,how do they do
5,the public at large
5,the people who didnt
5,and the basic idea
5,with these kind of
5,through some of the
5,a lot more and
5,idea here is that
5,if there were no
5,russ i couldnt agree
5,a little too much
5,how we look at
5,to the tune of
5,holding everything else constant
5,was a little more
5,time in prison or
5,a lot of listeners
5,but why is it
5,is what is going
5,i have with that
5,to give you any
5,is when you have
5,the thing you are
5,you are suggesting thats
5,dont necessarily have to
5,have to start with
5,as i said the
5,everybody has the same
5,ones that have been
5,where they were before
5,its not because the
5,can you do that
5,to the heart of
5,its important to remember
5,money to pay for
5,is less than the
5,to have something to
5,not going to use
5,i think was the
5,the first place so
5,and you use the
5,the best of a
5,as a consequence they
5,those things i think
5,very hard to find
5,debt in the future
5,5 years from now
5,seemed to be a
5,with the great depression
5,i didnt say that
5,things you need to
5,russ theres a lot
5,but to me the
5,the economy would be
5,the list of things
5,not because they dont
5,of the demand for
5,we can learn from
5,it may have been
5,just to get a
5,the conditions under which
5,its better to do
5,are and what they
5,but you can see
5,if you take away
5,the monetary history of
5,get government out of
5,to some of these
5,what you would call
5,the face of it
5,teach like a champion
5,im going to talk
5,because the economy is
5,in 2008 and 2009
5,says is that the
5,of our jobs are
5,and we can make
5,they are the most
5,there is a new
5,i dont know which
5,where if you are
5,to make a judgment
5,would have a very
5,spending other peoples money
5,if its not a
5,and the other half
5,the fascinating things about
5,the consent of the
5,now there are some
5,us a lot of
5,would you like to
5,going to have enough
5,dont know enough to
5,lot of political power
5,great depression in the
5,economics as a discipline
5,of the constitution and
5,you were in the
5,kind of like a
5,last 40 or 50
5,about who is in
5,you are suggesting is
5,who was the first
5,so in the end
5,of things like that
5,the best interest of
5,a good idea or
5,health care and education
5,a world that is
5,backed by the government
5,the pretence of knowledge
5,would be sort of
5,i think its such
5,thats a very different
5,and its important to
5,large differences in the
5,you might have to
5,because most people dont
5,gotten a lot more
5,something on the order
5,and it was the
5,with each other they
5,a little of both
5,going on for a
5,to think of a
5,the argument that its
5,and we talk about
5,if there had been
5,if they had been
5,whats wrong with it
5,it was only the
5,to come into the
5,have a sense that
5,the banks and they
5,is that theres a
5,and he said the
5,i dont think most
5,a lot of little
5,the last time i
5,other point i want
5,united states and they
5,it used to have
5,the number of times
5,the things that really
5,then there have been
5,and i talked to
5,i want to shift
5,about it on the
5,i think the point
5,what it should be
5,most people dont know
5,to end up in
5,if you lose your
5,comes down to a
5,the reason why we
5,to believe that this
5,pay it back and
5,it will come out
5,between the state and
5,going to be left
5,who are the people
5,to work hard and
5,by the nature of
5,for the same reason
5,its a great question
5,we had to do
5,is on the rise
5,the u of rochester
5,some interesting things to
5,we want to keep
5,because on the one
5,whats going on right
5,and ill tell you
5,to spend it on
5,think most people think
5,argument in the book
5,that i do think
5,of the population is
5,the other side but
5,book is that it
5,a really good idea
5,i think we all
5,is in fact the
5,a lot of experience
5,and it should be
5,would add to that
5,with high levels of
5,play by the rules
5,to say in a
5,have anything to say
5,have to do in
5,i was involved in
5,is they want to
5,he said to me
5,in the real estate
5,would have thought that
5,long would it take
5,and the result of
5,that kind of stuff
5,united states there are
5,so then the question
5,i know some people
5,one way in which
5,is as you point
5,tail of the distribution
5,but in the process
5,is it seems to
5,and when you see
5,of the characteristics of
5,why are they important
5,what i like about
5,is that an accurate
5,are very concerned about
5,in the distribution of
5,a new set of
5,as you talk about
5,is probably not going
5,it was before the
5,that is that its
5,at that point in
5,of people and the
5,not the way we
5,what kinds of things
5,if you do this
5,a part of our
5,so he had a
5,want to get your
5,guest well im not
5,the goal of education
5,everyone has the same
5,out on a limb
5,or at least to
5,is a great thing
5,have happened if the
5,accept the point that
5,problem i have is
5,the other way to
5,going to get this
5,the fact that in
5,dont have any idea
5,that the most important
5,was going on there
5,to have the right
5,of us on the
5,as good as the
5,a little bit harder
5,have to go and
5,passed the stamp act
5,going to be done
5,why you have to
5,the first one is
5,made it into the
5,they otherwise would have
5,think its a bad
5,whats interesting about that
5,to what extent is
5,back to work and
5,lots of people who
5,use that as a
5,going to find that
5,to put in place
5,on the righthand side
5,are the beneficiaries of
5,make sure you are
5,we have a huge
5,can do about it
5,back and forth and
5,to think like an
5,most of these things
5,about what the fed
5,want to do anything
5,be done i think
5,30 40 years ago
5,you do about it
5,what we think is
5,its too expensive to
5,in a plug for
5,then some of the
5,said at the time
5,i think the data
5,have the opportunity to
5,then there is the
5,the context of the
5,is the equivalent of
5,again a lot of
5,so long as we
5,its an open question
5,most people dont have
5,the other part is
5,first of all this
5,is that even though
5,talked about at the
5,will have a lot
5,to start with an
5,people who are willing
5,to tell the story
5,have to be really
5,the gap between the
5,dont want to use
5,and then after the
5,with the help of
5,have been around for
5,a good point guest
5,point out in your
5,has in the past
5,and well get to
5,things that could be
5,when you start looking
5,of things that arent
5,time and it was
5,you think of this
5,that we think are
5,what youve done is
5,and i hope well
5,the way of the
5,a lot bigger than
5,the only thing you
5,a way of making
5,talk about the implications
5,of it in the
5,it and i dont
5,we think we are
5,you are one of
5,it turns out in
5,raise the value of
5,who is in charge
5,in the book so
5,in a very specific
5,of the work that
5,other things that we
5,what you would have
5,the main thing is
5,want to be that
5,we agree on that
5,i think we know
5,to argue that the
5,that arent going to
5,to see a lot
5,in some sense of
5,that if we had
5,in the financial industry
5,of other people who
5,russ lets close with
5,whats happening in the
5,i agree guest and
5,than they did in
5,we are sort of
5,more worried about the
5,can see it in
5,to be affected by
5,the world and how
5,one example of that
5,home loan bank board
5,and that we are
5,we get out of
5,come along and say
5,some of this is
5,to act in a
5,even in the united
5,when you see that
5,in the first two
5,an interesting thing to
5,of them and they
5,is true is that
5,think is part of
5,it has a very
5,in the first case
5,pay for it but
5,be a kind of
5,for the federal government
5,to be honest about
5,states in the last
5,is a better way
5,about it guest well
5,increase the money supply
5,i believe it was
5,when i interviewed milton
5,its a sure thing
5,what they did is
5,came to the conclusion
5,as far as we
5,road to serfdom which
5,an axe to grind
5,that russ i dont
5,it and there are
5,what i would do
5,and then on top
5,the number of students
5,reasonable amount of time
5,so this is just
5,it a lot and
5,be as good as
5,in and of themselves
5,to cope with that
5,a lot of companies
5,out on the edge
5,thats right if you
5,what he saw as
5,that was the thing
5,are not very effective
5,back 100 cents on
5,his argument is that
5,and you are saying
5,would you rather have
5,thats not what you
5,ideas in the book
5,this is the most
5,said im going to
5,now we have to
5,again one of the
5,a lot of financial
5,and its a little
5,to find the right
5,in the wrong way
5,and the relationship between
5,on the stock market
5,the end of it
5,would want to have
5,but i believe that
5,going to make money
5,i still think that
5,a good sense of
5,the exact same thing
5,in the next 10
5,lot of things in
5,i think it could
5,dont worry about it
5,how to get there
5,of how to get
5,and what are some
5,russ lets start with
5,a lot of factors
5,the whole concept of
5,the great depression there
5,part of the solution
5,that they need to
5,says we have to
5,it is to get
5,by the way it
5,but i think people
5,how much time do
5,i want to use
5,trying to get people
5,have no way of
5,which is this idea
5,say this is the
5,it makes more sense
5,what is happening in
5,to say well if
5,right if you are
5,your book which is
5,of the reasons its
5,dont see a lot
5,guest i have to
5,what you paid for
5,when they try to
5,you are in your
5,so you need to
5,go back to my
5,so you can see
5,and we know what
5,are getting a lot
5,are going to want
5,people all over the
5,back to the 1980s
5,it its going to
5,decide what to do
5,to get a very
5,think that that is
5,to the problems of
5,are trying to help
5,a way of saying
5,up the price and
5,is not really a
5,difference between those two
5,to try to take
5,know it was a
5,you want to use
5,slow on the uptake
5,to see how that
5,can make a lot
5,being part of the
5,well talk about what
5,for me to do
5,over the last 25
5,people who think that
5,in the public interest
5,the future and thats
5,you know its a
5,had to choose between
5,issue and i think
5,just going to go
5,role of the state
5,they wanted to be
5,and i always say
5,need to find a
5,that is that there
5,that the financial sector
5,hard to do the
5,part of the same
5,have to say about
5,spend a lot more
5,move in and out
5,all sorts of other
5,even though he was
5,as i was reading
5,out in the middle
5,we want it to
5,when there was a
5,in the summer of
5,on right now in
5,is and i think
5,and im sure there
5,and well come back
5,it is interesting that
5,allowed to do that
5,of it its a
5,thats not what happens
5,give us some examples
5,some of the challenges
5,buy a house and
5,these kinds of changes
5,make a good living
5,going to look for
5,going to be successful
5,the past 20 years
5,are some of them
5,that we have some
5,part of it so
5,to be a successful
5,guest well we have
5,if we do that
5,think we need a
5,best we can do
5,i completely agree with
5,if you put the
5,that correct guest yes
5,its a beautiful thing
5,there are these things
5,the last 3040 years
5,the money supply but
5,going to be interesting
5,if it werent for
5,they just have different
5,is to say the
5,the point is there
5,fool yourself and you
5,about a year ago
5,they are designed to
5,what evidence do we
5,as long as it
5,the rights of the
5,they are doing and
5,they are out of
5,agree with you more
5,the only person who
5,but they are still
5,the fed has been
5,trying to do and
5,the demand for the
5,which i think would
5,y and z and
5,to do it because
5,60 hours a week
5,you know one of
5,is the way we
5,who happen to be
5,enormous sums of money
5,think you and i
5,the peak of the
5,think there are other
5,to act as if
5,the other thing you
5,and the history of
5,economists are not very
5,once youve done that
5,look at the whole
5,put a bunch of
5,the form of a
5,a lot about this
5,we have to go
5,and you can be
5,have to have more
5,these kinds of problems
5,and they are in
5,more than they are
5,know exactly how much
5,point and i think
5,is that the right
5,that it really is
5,that for a while
5,to avoid having to
5,didnt have a choice
5,and by that i
5,then we are going
5,in the presidents budget
5,supply and demand in
5,we dont like the
5,to say that this
5,you are quite right
5,do we know guest
5,i go out and
5,we talked about this
5,the other side its
5,course a lot of
5,i just think that
5,so its not an
5,able to do this
5,want to think of
5,side of it and
5,lot of people thought
5,and the theory of
5,on a scale of
5,get out of this
5,like you to talk
5,small amounts of money
5,and you try to
5,sides of the market
5,they have to go
5,i had a lot
5,trying to do but
5,it but if you
5,move away from the
5,cause of the great
5,where he says the
5,russ well thats a
5,put in place to
5,think are the most
5,and so the idea
5,learn how to do
5,good example of that
5,to steer the economy
5,are very few people
5,a bit in the
5,it we want to
5,have a lot less
5,job that pays the
5,terms of how much
5,to get things done
5,the case for that
5,very important part of
5,fact that they had
5,course of a year
5,as it used to
5,flip side of the
5,have a certain amount
5,about it in terms
5,its hard to be
5,because it could be
5,to be that way
5,it for a while
5,hell of a lot
5,the price level is
5,the same thing for
5,are many people who
5,that good or bad
5,who won the nobel
5,is that good or
5,that should be the
5,that there is not
5,to start a new
5,reserves out of the
5,the places that have
5,of those people who
5,no way of knowing
5,at the same level
5,lot of people find
5,was the most important
5,things that can be
5,argue that thats a
5,the united states doesnt
5,things to do with
5,the time was that
5,and some of these
5,at the fact that
5,they would be in
5,place where there is
5,shows up in the
5,turn it on and
5,part of the government
5,but you dont know
5,in trying to understand
5,are talking about its
5,is a good one
5,you are at the
5,need to go to
5,problems and i think
5,you have to put
5,to make as much
5,i think in many
5,guest exactly russ so
5,these things and then
5,and people are going
5,of the world as
5,out of that is
5,is consistent with the
5,and they are making
5,and then we get
5,hard to keep the
5,that take place in
5,make sure i understand
5,you know what you
5,doesnt mean that you
5,i think in economics
5,about that i dont
5,to change it and
5,you said its a
5,a number of studies
5,to look like a
5,happened in the united
5,10 years or so
5,going to happen with
5,across the board in
5,and so even though
5,the direction of the
5,of course a lot
5,does that mean guest
5,know you are going
5,of the big banks
5,to make it possible
5,to figure out why
5,but we need to
5,that when you think
5,to just look at
5,you go from a
5,is to say we
5,the socialist calculation debate
5,because there is this
5,is an empirical question
5,one thing that is
5,what do we need
5,i think in this
5,i was looking at
5,certainly a lot of
5,trying to find out
5,to look for the
5,to turn to the
5,way that some of
5,a couple of the
5,the only way of
5,people argue that the
5,the fraction of the
5,with the federal reserve
5,to live in this
5,if the stock market
5,to say about that
5,theres a sort of
5,out to be so
5,that struck me about
5,i think the fact
5,at the rate of
5,it and i was
5,to think of that
5,why dont we have
5,the question i want
5,go out and spend
5,government out of the
5,the kind of behavior
5,we know that because
5,how expensive it is
5,no way to get
5,we havent had a
5,things we have to
5,think most of us
5,tell you anything about
5,and if i had
5,that if we didnt
5,is something that i
5,they ought to be
5,the drug companies and
5,cut to the chase
5,some of the history
5,all these other things
5,that its not going
5,a lot of social
5,between the individual and
5,to talk about today
5,relative to the united
5,fraction of what it
5,only a couple of
5,of what to do
5,of the people and
5,where do you get
5,going to be that
5,a chance to talk
5,the next 20 years
5,the recent financial crisis
5,kinds of things are
5,out there who are
5,i will give you
5,of a bunch of
5,but a little bit
5,talked about which is
5,its just that they
5,of reasons one is
5,on the job and
5,kind of thing we
5,want to subsidize the
5,we got out of
5,lot of people on
5,is that part of
5,of moral sentiments by
5,would it be better
5,exactly right and so
5,problem which is the
5,role to play in
5,about it which is
5,have a very high
5,that and then i
5,do that you have
5,lot of the world
5,a little bit i
5,in being able to
5,the people who would
5,thats what it is
5,at least in some
5,was my next question
5,they will be bailed
5,and you cant get
5,what do we think
5,you and i dont
5,lot of the stuff
5,us what you did
5,and looking at the
5,question is why does
5,they are not using
5,think it comes from
5,system is going to
5,going to be like
5,about the future of
5,the problem is you
5,can talk about it
5,one thing i would
5,the people who pay
5,in the lives of
5,in a while but
5,its a very different
5,question is what is
5,to not have to
5,it can be a
5,when you look back
5,the absence of that
5,where you are in
5,wanted to go to
5,of the population so
5,such a good job
5,can we do to
5,for it but the
5,but my guess is
5,take a different approach
5,in the end of
5,europe and the united
5,in the black swan
5,and so we can
5,didnt work very well
5,i guess what i
5,theres a limit to
5,to what it was
5,whether we are going
5,will not be able
5,of the reason they
5,so there could be
5,very difficult to measure
5,and what do we
5,friends and family and
5,they are doing but
5,you can see a
5,the only country that
5,in a year or
5,the rest of this
5,a price for that
5,i dont want the
5,it cant be that
5,it sounds like you
5,guest yeah well the
5,for us to be
5,want to go there
5,when you are older
5,of money into the
5,your argument is that
5,whats the source of
5,people who disagree with
5,with bruce bueno de
5,the one hand the
5,that in my view
5,carbon dioxide in the
5,so i think if
5,repeal of the corn
5,let me start with
5,of specialization and trade
5,but not the only
5,doesnt work so well
5,increase in demand for
5,say im not going
5,used to have to
5,maybe there will be
5,a good job and
5,going to have trouble
5,you do need to
5,going to get very
5,to have a hard
5,that the reason we
5,first half of the
5,the united states when
5,i went to the
5,back to some of
5,it the fact that
5,idea that we have
5,there is a sense
5,doesnt want to be
5,so what we are
5,but i think they
5,sense that there are
5,i think is important
5,we know what we
5,that in the absence
5,so it must be
5,not a good time
5,got rid of it
5,because you are a
5,can find a way
5,work and i think
5,and of course if
5,the fed has done
5,a couple of ways
5,what some of the
5,was a huge increase
5,in the 1980s in
5,figure out what they
5,a stake in it
5,stimulate the economy and
5,lot more in the
5,kind of reaction have
5,one of my students
5,and after a while
5,the banking system is
5,feel a little bit
5,would happen if we
5,by the time it
5,very large fraction of
5,proper role of government
5,like to do that
5,last decade or so
5,guest yes so the
5,im going to let
5,its not quite the
5,russ and by the
5,cant charge for it
5,the way it has
5,going to create a
5,is not a lot
5,you are not doing
5,some of that money
5,at the time were
5,its nice to have
5,know if you want
5,the age of 20
5,would say there is
5,your way out of
5,and bank of america
5,the last 40 or
5,so that is the
5,you can sell it
5,they want to know
5,it as it is
5,do you see this
5,the wrong kind of
5,idea is that we
5,to make a decision
5,they just dont have
5,is what you are
5,talk about the people
5,i would have a
5,well i have a
5,think this is going
5,like to point out
5,end of the 18th
5,goods and services but
5,but what it really
5,they want to live
5,so give us a
5,dont feel that way
5,get a good job
5,if you went to
5,here is that the
5,used to be called
5,to do in a
5,at this point we
5,its not hard to
5,the part i think
5,look at the financial
5,with you and i
5,your standard of living
5,as part of their
5,for people who were
5,by which i mean
5,going to agree on
5,turns out there is
5,a tiny fraction of
5,about one of the
5,do i know that
5,are other people who
5,on this program that
5,of people out there
5,where do you see
5,the right direction but
5,or is that just
5,is such a thing
5,two reasons one is
5,in the way in
5,if you know that
5,by any stretch of
5,the data in the
5,you are listening to
5,because most of the
5,think the problem with
5,just happened to be
5,do you know that
5,its a very hayekian
5,and my view is
5,you wont be able
5,reduce the number of
5,willing to accept the
5,that appears to be
5,of them and i
5,you are not as
5,are only going to
5,we can figure out
5,say well what about
5,a lot of data
5,want to go through
5,have we learned about
5,how to use the
5,comes down to is
5,as a jumping off
5,has to step in
5,this idea of the
5,to bail them out
5,i think the people
5,and its not clear
5,20 years ago in
5,your way to the
5,you do that in
5,have to be the
5,i think it should
5,obviously theres a lot
5,million people in the
5,able to figure out
5,or the united states
5,go a long way
5,we see it in
5,dont want to think
5,up with an idea
5,the same people over
5,doesnt have much to
5,been able to borrow
5,all of these are
5,has never been a
5,lot of romance about
5,among young black men
5,things that we do
5,few years ago and
5,thought of as the
5,the book you talk
5,we need to keep
5,at the time they
5,yes i think that
5,who think that the
5,are interested in is
5,happening on the ground
5,is by the way
5,kind of things that
5,federal communications commission fcc
5,russ so what do
5,up but i think
5,were worried about the
5,to the top of
5,to be interesting to
5,way to go and
5,they want to hold
5,the interest on reserves
5,the economy would have
5,as it was before
5,a good idea that
5,comes from the fact
5,is not so much
5,all of the studies
5,to do and so
5,that come out of
5,of what we would
5,is very important in
5,and then there were
5,think would be a
5,this a little bit
5,in a country like
5,there are two different
5,something about it and
5,but by the time
5,be the equivalent of
5,it but there are
5,were people who were
5,because of the nature
5,bring it back to
5,of the game and
5,and then all of
5,why we get fat
5,lets talk about it
5,the 19th century that
5,want to do and
5,and i would add
5,now i think that
5,the soviet union was
5,going to happen if
5,say that it is
5,is one way to
5,by virtue of the
5,health care and the
5,do it and i
5,how do you figure
5,of the advantages of
5,think the evidence is
5,do in the united
5,but what i would
5,have a free market
5,as we get wealthier
5,go ahead guest so
5,what kind of a
5,make sense to me
5,be taken care of
5,if you like the
5,and then i can
5,where it comes from
5,examples in the book
5,important point is that
5,as you said its
5,that we do have
5,of those things i
5,for that but you
5,group versus the control
5,you think that was
5,has a kind of
5,and that might be
5,on the planet and
5,and so they were
5,the shape of the
5,me but i think
5,big to fail and
5,dollars a year and
5,in the end they
5,very large number of
5,if it hadnt been
5,not going to allow
5,dont need to have
5,front of the store
5,i think what happened
5,of these sorts of
5,its just that we
5,of people to make
5,i said at the
5,not a big problem
5,you pay for that
5,you start off by
5,dont have to get
5,future and i think
5,its going to cost
5,lot of things and
5,i know enough about
5,of the arguments that
5,the short run it
5,all of that and
5,you get down to
5,way of doing things
5,it should be doing
5,go up by a
5,for its own sake
5,up in front of
5,out of a job
5,of people at the
5,that people like to
5,thought that was a
5,what the value of
5,going to have that
5,probably the most important
5,compared to other countries
5,said that if you
5,couple of different ways
5,that but im not
5,are going to apply
5,ended up with a
5,they do what they
5,the way you think
5,years ago which is
5,and how did the
5,cant get there from
5,so thats one way
5,the last thing we
5,so i think they
5,on this program in
5,on this program is
5,im going to call
5,that i agree with
5,millions of jobs being
5,a couple of reasons
5,to do that as
5,than they would have
5,in your book and
5,so thats a problem
5,way i think of
5,then you also have
5,so when people say
5,of the system and
5,would have access to
5,russ and if you
5,that wouldnt have been
5,in terms of fiscal
5,money to buy the
5,a few years later
5,as he saw it
5,to you if you
5,because we have this
5,the national bureau of
5,im talking about is
5,are not so good
5,i think its much
5,with the way the
5,but i think most
5,didnt have to have
5,if by an invisible
5,do you have in
5,taking in more energy
5,what do they have
5,spent some time in
5,what i find interesting
5,the people who go
5,did you get involved
5,it means is that
5,to do this they
5,agree with you about
5,going to give a
5,hold everything else constant
5,power of the fed
5,view is that the
5,at the time this
5,on one side of
5,in the next 5
5,you didnt have the
5,there can be no
5,would be hard to
5,so they are the
5,american society of civil
5,wins and who loses
5,and yet i think
5,when we are trying
5,a price for it
5,balance sheet of the
5,going to read the
5,in the country and
5,have a theory of
5,who are not so
5,how can we get
5,to have a better
5,talked a lot about
5,so what you have
5,it can lead to
5,and not have to
5,people talk about the
5,an article in the
5,all the way up
5,they are doing well
5,its hard not to
5,and then if we
5,to go on to
5,dont think its the
5,but because they are
5,the exact number but
5,and what does that
5,how many people were
5,well you know the
5,that when we are
5,in the 1930s when
5,and you sort of
5,to be worried about
5,of course we could
5,is not the case
5,it could just be
5,see that there are
5,large groups of people
5,to live in san
5,they want to go
5,im not saying that
5,when it became clear
5,government should be doing
5,to use the word
5,they didnt do it
5,is the way you
5,a little bit differently
5,for example if we
5,the problem is its
5,in the world not
5,we have to deal
5,more than just a
5,to find people who
5,the other thing they
5,and then well talk
5,able to make a
5,talk to people who
5,want to work for
5,the notion that the
5,thats true i dont
5,the republican party is
5,and i wonder if
5,would be a problem
5,were talking about it
5,the government is in
5,the same people who
5,when the unemployment rate
5,they just want to
5,an email at mailecontalkorg
5,as well which is
5,then a lot of
5,people have a lot
5,in the federal funds
5,really hard to do
5,a little bit the
5,dont care about money
5,and even if we
5,know they are going
5,question is whats the
5,be a mistake to
5,us a little bit
5,that was a way
5,you react to it
5,because of changes in
5,most of what we
5,of the things is
5,that he had a
5,would have been more
5,to think about a
5,supply and demand are
5,put it to the
5,to go along with
5,to do it if
5,up in the same
5,that i think about
5,coming out of their
5,a correct way to
5,i think in terms
5,i like what you
5,years ago it was
5,teach to the test
5,we just dont have
5,dropped out of high
5,i dont find it
5,in the free market
5,a little bit longer
5,to be subject to
5,weve just been talking
5,the result is that
5,not in the data
5,and along the way
5,go back to our
5,generates a lot of
5,well come to that
5,in a free market
5,aspects of the economy
5,years ago i think
5,any one of them
5,we need to pay
5,russ before we get
5,going up and down
5,give us a little
5,and all that but
5,can do better than
5,in the creation of
5,we are doing now
5,they just need to
5,it out of the
5,about the way the
5,do you figure out
5,over the last couple
5,its not what the
5,do what you are
5,you have a large
5,think about it so
5,raise the debt limit
5,the state of our
5,to know about the
5,than it is to
5,you can show that
5,they would have done
5,and that will be
5,i would worry about
5,that they can do
5,was more of a
5,of course it would
5,i want to stick
5,i think of that
5,the price of gasoline
5,the lives of the
5,of how do you
5,was in many ways
5,the relative price of
5,in terms of economic
5,to be a bit
5,and as you know
5,it will be the
5,the highest level of
5,going to raise the
5,you give in the
5,are going to save
5,can get rid of
5,to be at a
5,have a feel for
5,and so theres a
5,now i think the
5,if you dont think
5,in the book this
5,hope we can get
5,should be thinking about
5,there was a bit
5,if you step back
5,about a number of
5,of the ways that
5,the same time but
5,i thought it would
5,a lot of important
5,as if you are
5,theres a huge amount
5,the german historical school
5,seeing a lot of
5,there is no burden
5,going to be used
5,but i agree with
5,people were able to
5,at least a little
5,me come back to
5,the question of what
5,just that they dont
5,issues that come up
5,lets say you have
5,the two of you
5,the evidence that this
5,want to lose weight
5,the image of the
5,at least for a
5,get the benefit of
5,so here we have
5,they could do it
5,and i see it
5,the last 200 years
5,from some of the
5,because what you are
5,when we talked about
5,think its useful to
5,for a while there
5,that was a very
5,a lot of training
5,its an interesting point
5,your eggs in one
5,very little evidence that
5,yeah thats right and
5,but of course they
5,at it and say
5,all the stuff that
5,they do in the
5,more money into the
5,the time that the
5,if there are no
5,talked a little bit
5,it was that the
5,and the problem of
5,understand that there are
5,im not trying to
5,do much better than
5,its not a lot
5,and what would be
5,a lot of weight
5,to solve the problems
5,china is going to
5,and you think well
5,a variety of things
5,because we have to
5,lot of them were
5,vast majority of people
5,the way that he
5,lot of people i
5,we get to that
5,to come out and
5,change the nature of
5,has done quite well
5,thing to remember is
5,if you can have
5,was very much a
5,back to the same
5,wind up with a
5,a lot at the
5,there appears to be
5,russ well thats true
5,and if we could
5,to a gold standard
5,people like milton friedman
5,going to work in
5,you just get a
5,those with low levels
5,youd think it would
5,con out of econometrics
5,you had to have
5,out that a lot
5,of that of course
5,best of all possible
5,thats a great example
5,that has a lot
5,value of the house
5,i said i think
5,you can imagine a
5,you dont think thats
5,10 or 20 years
5,want to point out
5,lot of these things
5,it makes perfect sense
5,has led to the
5,to think of themselves
5,a number of the
5,little bit of time
5,some of these problems
5,and then i would
5,we do talk about
5,i want to push
5,but the interesting thing
5,thats a different story
5,i wanted to make
5,guest yeah there is
5,of the last 30
5,use it as a
5,they are not getting
5,what we really want
5,there is a small
5,i agree that the
5,i tend to be
5,the top 1 of
5,there is a cost
5,agree that there is
5,last half of the
5,but of course there
5,different points in time
5,but it would have
5,gets a lot of
5,even though there are
5,you could go to
5,the cost of making
5,with a sort of
5,you could call it
5,take advantage of them
5,you know its going
5,of course thats not
5,the social safety net
5,of your book and
5,going to do a
5,do they have to
5,i see it as
5,the banking system in
5,or at least not
5,that was a mistake
5,and thats the kind
5,awful lot of people
5,you have a big
5,most people in the
5,lots of other things
5,far away from the
5,because they have to
5,dont think theres a
5,one is if you
5,really talking about a
5,when you are making
5,that if i have
5,do you think were
5,that because it was
5,the envy of the
5,of the ways we
5,you want to put
5,in the past is
5,this program a few
5,because its a very
5,they are allowed to
5,interest rates are low
5,you happen to be
5,and it had a
5,a lot of differences
5,than a lot of
5,she is going to
5,we tend to be
5,you said in the
5,twice as much as
5,part of the american
5,none of these things
5,a lot of issues
5,like to see the
5,in competition with each
5,to keep the economy
5,go back and forth
5,and you could argue
5,in this case is
5,going to do what
5,why did they do
5,the people running the
5,give you another example
5,not to do that
5,and give it to
5,a bunch of individuals
5,is the impact of
5,their job is to
5,correct to say that
5,works and what doesnt
5,society of civil engineers
5,to some extent i
5,when i asked him
5,want to do the
5,just happen to be
5,we are not doing
5,of the administrative state
5,whether it should be
5,think when you look
5,is related to the
5,and i think when
5,lot of what government
5,i was in graduate
5,they were doing and
5,jobs are going to
5,and i used to
5,and we have the
5,on the issue of
5,that i think was
5,of it is there
5,before but i think
5,so this is an
5,the introduction of the
5,in an environment where
5,on the front page
5,part of whats going
5,closer to the truth
5,harder for me to
5,a question of the
5,years from now the
5,ways to do it
5,federal funds rate is
5,where the action is
5,way to make it
5,a very important part
5,the goal of the
5,are looking for the
5,onset of the great
5,if it was a
5,how things work and
5,argue that they are
5,a good deal of
5,it was much more
5,the expense of others
5,the most important part
5,book which is a
5,whats changed in the
5,but it may not
5,and most of them
5,is even worse than
5,at one point he
5,have to keep in
5,the founders of the
5,i asked him why
5,than it was at
5,when you looked at
5,guest this is a
5,dont know who you
5,of the house and
5,people arent going to
5,a little more of
5,the things in the
5,i think the book
5,on the history of
5,about the labor market
5,if you are part
5,be in charge of
5,united states as well
5,to spend other peoples
5,could have done something
5,envy of the world
5,the history of science
5,can give you a
5,people i dont think
5,then it would be
5,of the flavor of
5,to show up in
5,in the world around
5,lets start with a
5,the right level of
5,well move on to
5,that are going on
5,back in the day
5,my wife is a
5,we know and dont
5,things that look like
5,russ do you have
5,lot more people are
5,say were going to
5,than the cost of
5,you think you can
5,the checks and balances
5,system a lot of
5,agree with that and
5,has a hard time
5,here we have a
5,make a big difference
5,going to become more
5,the challenge is that
5,the example in the
5,start thinking about the
5,and the good society
5,you are on your
5,out how to use
5,something that a lot
5,i think youd be
5,the world that we
5,number of people have
5,rid of a lot
5,going to work for
5,some aspect of your
5,that turn out to
5,that we have and
5,we are interested in
5,because we care about
5,and if we have
5,guest yeah thats exactly
5,this is good for
5,learn a lot of
5,of doing that is
5,why is that important
5,go down to the
5,we dont know we
5,i do think you
5,all of them have
5,one of the cruelest
5,its not so bad
5,it and we are
5,they are better off
5,consequences of the peace
5,expense of the rest
5,of the worlds gold
5,in the 1970s the
5,are not trying to
5,what is a good
5,raise the interest rate
5,yet a lot of
5,of the 14th amendment
5,how often do you
5,a lot but the
5,me just give you
5,a difference in the
5,those things but the
5,people to make the
5,is kind of like
5,the nuts and bolts
5,to that of course
5,people who would have
5,so much of what
5,that its very hard
5,because i had to
5,have been trying to
5,the only way they
5,which is just a
5,these kind of issues
5,kind of people who
5,and so much of
5,of the day and
5,you said a minute
5,the money to the
5,ought to look at
5,problem a lot of
5,in fact it is
5,the invisible hand the
5,something that is not
5,start off by saying
5,in the world you
5,if in fact you
5,willing to accept that
5,in the 1920s the
5,would be an example
5,talk to people about
5,of how we think
5,the ability to be
5,there going to be
5,talking about in terms
5,do you explain that
5,to end up with
5,because we are all
5,but when you look
5,about what it means
5,of your book is
5,is the one who
5,was that in the
5,the stock market was
5,for a minute if
5,of the class and
5,that have not been
5,why we have a
5,that the banks were
5,but its not going
5,totally agree with that
5,terms of the business
5,i think we will
5,to do what i
5,about how the world
5,we care about is
5,than it was before
5,want to hear that
5,for at least a
5,of division of labor
5,want to find out
5,things going on in
5,well if you look
5,which you have to
5,the early 1980s and
5,keep the price of
5,im not sure you
5,and there are people
5,and how much of
5,this is true of
5,the book one of
5,will tell you that
5,guest i think he
5,but its a little
5,i wish i could
5,about this before but
5,some of these other
5,glass is half full
5,got rid of the
5,pay for it and
5,to make the right
5,dont have very good
5,and if the government
5,in the open market
5,economics in the last
5,says law of markets
5,on the fiscal side
5,are trying to create
5,to do it very
5,about 15 years ago
5,really dont want to
5,part of it that
5,the key thing is
5,i mean they are
5,to have to come
5,would tell you that
5,dont talk about it
5,bad thing to do
5,which is the same
5,one of the only
5,do you mean guest
5,as an economist that
5,of the market is
5,back and forth on
5,a central part of
5,the minimum wage and
5,that well if you
5,is something that a
5,and if we had
5,where the united states
5,good friend of mine
5,have a very very
5,problem is if you
5,so we dont know
5,for me when i
5,the market and the
5,a way to do
5,have to kind of
5,of government spending on
5,rest of the time
5,worst thing you can
5,is to get the
5,runs through the book
5,is trying to get
5,he thought that the
5,which was the first
5,get to the bottom
5,period of time but
5,on the back of
5,and so what i
5,to say well the
5,the first thing he
5,that people should be
5,going to find out
5,fancy way of saying
5,in the coming year
5,of time talking about
5,a little different from
5,have to make decisions
5,i assume they are
5,to make a long
5,i think its worse
5,come up with new
5,the people who dont
5,something you have to
5,the austrian business cycle
5,get out of poverty
5,the national level and
5,and being able to
5,the way you look
5,of time before we
5,in which we have
5,doing as well as
5,to have it in
5,the first place but
5,changes in tax rates
5,guest right exactly russ
5,get a bunch of
5,in which case we
5,understand what they are
5,one of the two
5,the book and then
5,of the work of
5,the basic idea of
5,many of these countries
5,now is the time
5,that many of them
5,had the right to
5,its really important to
5,would have to pay
5,all of that stuff
5,the things that have
5,that many people who
5,property rights and the
5,that this was going
5,they are a little
5,and you are in
5,so there would be
5,if you look for
5,then you get to
5,the other would be
5,that they are the
5,and again i think
5,at the k12 level
5,using the internet to
5,it but of course
5,to bring it up
5,to be different and
5,late 1970s early 1980s
5,so the real question
5,the business cycle the
5,of time thinking about
5,had to make a
5,russ so the other
5,cost of living adjustments
5,going to think about
5,we care about and
5,to be the key
5,like the great depression
5,the middle of this
5,dont want to spend
5,of the political process
5,things that we have
5,that the bank of
5,the past 50 years
5,guest its a great
5,who came up with
5,the 19th century the
5,how does that work
5,and so in that
5,are going to play
5,the growth in the
5,if you did that
5,and there have been
5,i live in a
5,from a lot of
5,that the market is
5,you are involved in
5,lot of people like
5,we have a few
5,lots of other stuff
5,that they are making
5,have picked it up
5,to decide what to
5,looking for a job
5,didnt have access to
5,and when you have
5,more and more money
5,happened in the past
5,we continue to have
5,i know that the
5,dont know guest well
5,they were on the
5,the united states from
5,the problem i think
5,do we do now
5,when i look to
5,a question of who
5,going to get really
5,which is the most
5,what i am saying
5,that thats a good
5,talking about in the
5,of the world if
5,the long run is
5,didnt work so well
5,about the current state
5,terms of the way
5,think thats what we
5,i see a lot
5,and there are more
5,this was going on
5,years a lot of
5,we have not been
5,if we could only
5,but it cant be
5,it was a mistake
5,health and human services
5,job it is to
5,im going to buy
5,united states at the
5,we know is that
5,the effects of the
5,is that there was
5,back to the question
5,a hard time getting
5,in fact most of
5,when i go to
5,at that point the
5,to do it a
5,10 years from now
5,see that in the
5,need to do to
5,good thing for the
5,i think its possible
5,russ well i guess
5,they are never going
5,in the current crisis
5,this is what happened
5,incentive for people to
5,were talking about here
5,between rich and poor
5,i like the idea
5,money to buy a
5,how they are going
5,the way they think
5,i think the great
5,the stock market does
5,again i dont think
5,those who won the
5,people are starting to
5,would allow us to
5,wanted to get the
5,im going to reduce
5,people who are on
5,all the time is
5,comes to the united
5,the core of the
5,are out of the
5,it turned out okay
5,to help with the
5,with all kinds of
5,to stay on the
5,what we observe in
5,made the observation that
5,out of work and
5,to find good people
5,thats going to come
5,why is that relevant
5,so there are some
5,is its not just
5,that could lead to
5,that means you have
5,the banks and the
5,it is part of
5,is the right way
5,a little bit which
5,we know there is
5,a series of questions
5,to get the money
5,is that its hard
5,on the dollar and
5,to get away with
5,the possibility that the
5,issue a lot of
5,i think youre right
5,so when i say
5,you ask the question
5,so what are the
5,agree with you so
5,of it but you
5,the odds of a
5,would have picked it
5,do we do about
5,is a very complicated
5,you are right the
5,im willing to accept
5,want there to be
5,that much of the
5,because the people who
5,at a time of
5,for most people and
5,and im not saying
5,but the rest of
5,have a system where
5,and the ability to
5,if you are asking
5,part of it the
5,they get into trouble
5,they are not all
5,that we have now
5,what he meant by
5,do lots of things
5,dont need to know
5,how does that affect
5,united states right now
5,if you were going
5,russ so lets turn
5,the problem is is
5,to go through this
5,taken over by the
5,i dont believe in
5,have a vested interest
5,pushing on a string
5,say that again guest
5,to take more risk
5,at any one time
5,what we are saying
5,more you have to
5,that leads to the
5,knowledge of time and
5,best you can do
5,bit in the book
5,value of the land
5,of the total amount
5,id like to do
5,the 90th percentile and
5,is of course that
5,to the future and
5,before we go on
5,the thing that i
5,the most part the
5,thought was going to
5,most important thing is
5,to that because i
5,to be called the
5,teach people to be
5,the health care bill
5,side of the balance
5,but you cant get
5,what was happening in
5,it when i was
5,on what you said
5,going to be less
5,its not a matter
5,not the right way
5,i think i am
5,in order to pay
5,the world at the
5,is to be able
5,and to be honest
5,to hang out with
5,mutual sympathy of sentiments
5,think thats an important
5,to remember is that
5,i think it helps
5,worked in the past
5,happened is that the
5,not only in the
5,what they did with
5,thing is i think
5,a strong incentive to
5,im going to disagree
5,was the way to
5,that but i do
5,about what will happen
5,now i have to
5,in that case it
5,which are going to
5,who want to make
5,i am not an
5,that because you are
5,a factor of 10
5,of that but the
5,were able to grow
5,are trying to find
5,lot going on there
5,you dont think the
5,kind of person who
5,a lot of natural
5,it is very hard
5,the veil of ignorance
5,but we still have
5,to be clear about
5,is a good way
5,i think for me
5,the late 1970s early
5,is a man who
5,part of what i
5,of them are not
5,its not a question
5,a system where you
5,out what the right
5,thats not at all
5,some people argue that
5,they dont look at
5,that the government would
5,the time this was
5,whats interesting about the
5,we talked about before
5,so why do you
5,that even if we
5,back at the last
5,many things that we
5,i think we would
5,a key part of
5,in a way to
5,going to bring it
5,that are hard to
5,think its a great
5,they are doing with
5,a variety of different
5,a long time the
5,to do that when
5,so it is not
5,you need to get
5,a lot of gold
5,concern that i have
5,about the role that
5,whole bunch of things
5,but now we are
5,are not all that
5,we start with the
5,know what it was
5,to have a very
5,is it possible to
5,is there was a
5,fair labor standards act
5,is a dangerous thing
5,but the evidence is
5,to cut back on
5,to take it away
5,it makes them feel
5,look at the way
5,the last 2030 years
5,i disagree with you
5,in the long term
5,is going to run
5,have to pay in
5,and if you take
5,of the argument that
5,20 hours a week
5,you have the right
5,that if we dont
5,that we are living
5,in the future when
5,a month or so
5,i know there are
5,there is kind of
5,system i dont think
5,out of the air
5,want to live there
5,right a lot of
5,to borrow the money
5,i thought this is
5,has been one of
5,be able to give
5,with you that the
5,were looking at the
5,became more and more
5,the things i find
5,how long would it
5,at what is the
5,look at all of
5,we have so many
5,think thats a little
5,in exactly the same
5,and those who are
5,to think about in
5,i like to use
5,the potential of the
5,that government is going
5,about the difficulties of
5,have this sort of
5,the financial sector in
5,which is you know
5,with this kind of
5,that the whole thing
5,prices are going to
5,what we can say
5,discount rate that we
5,and so thats one
5,the alternative would be
5,the lack of transparency
5,didnt have time to
5,the argument is that
5,need a lot more
5,to the bank of
5,not the case that
5,say you know what
5,make their own decisions
5,what you need is
5,if you say to
5,on the list of
5,on one side or
5,and they are really
5,about what you think
5,are part of a
5,about the human enterprise
5,that you can see
5,you look at their
5,and try to understand
5,care of themselves and
5,you dont go to
5,that was not a
5,just been talking about
5,right now and i
5,in a position where
5,me if im wrong
5,that if you ask
5,i dont know of
5,get to the top
5,to some kind of
5,to use it to
5,the short run but
5,some of these countries
5,from an economists perspective
5,the idea was to
5,reasons one is that
5,is to go to
5,the united states will
5,people have argued that
5,to raise the debt
5,is no reason to
5,is that when i
5,for you and you
5,huge amounts of money
5,stretch of the imagination
5,the problem the problem
5,but in fact they
5,way in which this
5,to pay more for
5,it doesnt work that
5,what we were talking
5,a number of ways
5,so the bottom line
5,way that we can
5,the market in the
5,you an example of
5,a lot of cities
5,the reason why is
5,per year in the
5,how much does the
5,would be a much
5,argument would be that
5,and thats kind of
5,some part of the
5,do you find out
5,obviously you have to
5,a lot of excess
5,we have to ask
5,to its highest use
5,and what we know
5,where we dont have
5,i want to thank
5,these are kind of
5,other side of it
5,person on the other
5,part of it was
5,are living in a
5,on one side and
5,back to the 1960s
5,this idea that the
5,and there are no
5,and why did it
5,some of them were
5,of the reason it
5,only way to get
5,three or four years
5,the united states right
5,so you could argue
5,freedom of information act
5,it turns out i
5,that we are having
5,the fed would have
5,on on the ground
5,the short run to
5,way to run a
5,make it possible for
5,fed and the treasury
5,but lets look at
5,the labor market was
5,i think that i
5,of that comes from
5,to pay more attention
5,kinds of things like
5,were on the edge
5,states over the last
5,not i dont know
5,is it that when
5,well its going to
5,argument is that if
5,read your book i
5,you go through the
5,of thinking about it
5,but even if you
5,political will to do
5,trying to do that
5,not a bad thing
5,on the internet guest
5,on the ground that
5,to the average person
5,hes got a lot
5,would think of as
5,have some interesting things
5,if you actually look
5,so you are not
5,as a result its
5,parts of the book
5,will be on the
5,are not the ones
5,is sort of an
5,of the middle class
5,the same time so
5,to give you money
5,things like that so
5,government ought to be
5,are talking about guest
5,to do it now
5,we are not able
5,hard to get people
5,the point where the
5,that we used to
5,go up or down
5,the only kind of
5,were talking about before
5,so i think were
5,me give you another
5,of them are in
5,with people who are
5,on in the united
5,think about it but
5,the question of the
5,at it from a
5,going to be viable
5,the theory of money
5,half of what it
5,out of it but
5,tiger by the tail
5,in the first year
5,its a really bad
5,an argument to be
5,to pay a price
5,would be better to
5,hard to know how
5,down the road to
5,there are limits to
5,by the way russ
5,is kind of an
5,what i thought was
5,with the united states
5,what you could do
5,should get rid of
5,the benefits of the
5,that are trying to
5,the quality of teachers
5,lot of different ways
5,one possibility is that
5,a share of the
5,than it takes in
5,and the way people
5,a little bit at
5,as a young man
5,there are people out
5,probably the single most
5,there is a high
5,on their balance sheets
5,i have is that
5,and they are doing
5,think if you are
5,is this kind of
5,time and time again
5,the best thing that
5,that was in the
5,the last several decades
5,that i think what
5,just that we dont
5,to do which is
5,in the world so
5,they talk about the
5,if we can get
5,used to be but
5,to work for a
5,which is an interesting
5,having a tough time
5,going to become a
5,to the issue of
5,that somehow we are
5,really a lot of
5,so i went to
5,of you who are
5,leonard reads i pencil
5,which is not just
5,think the fact that
5,that the labor market
5,its pretty clear that
5,we dont have very
5,to get to your
5,away from the house
5,in some cases but
5,have done a lot
5,before we do i
5,by people who are
5,russ so its a
5,if you are making
5,to hear what you
5,russ yep guest and
5,of course they can
5,a limited number of
5,figure out whats going
5,so whats wrong with
5,and all of those
5,come in and say
5,its not something that
5,to be very hard
5,to a series of
5,this is the problem
5,very end of the
5,i certainly agree that
5,be to get rid
5,are they doing that
5,all kinds of stuff
5,they made a mistake
5,it at the same
5,you might not be
5,thing that struck me
5,talk about that i
5,it out to be
5,are trying to solve
5,you have in your
5,of a sense of
5,of the world was
5,yeah i think it
5,financial crisis of 2008
5,world in which we
5,you want to change
5,there doesnt seem to
5,that how do you
5,year or two ago
5,we can think about
5,that in this case
5,idea that we should
5,on the top 1
5,but lets just say
5,that they are all
5,fall in love with
5,we have to explain
5,we have to keep
5,the nature of that
5,nice to have a
5,the data and the
5,guest well no i
5,small compared to the
5,be better if we
5,a jumping off point
5,to take account of
5,is much more complicated
5,they used to have
5,would argue that it
5,which weve talked about
5,it doesnt seem like
5,there might not be
5,you talk a lot
5,is your book the
5,if you ask them
5,no problem with the
5,think most people are
5,we want to talk
5,a sense in which
5,but lets start with
5,we do a lot
5,put people back to
5,people tell me that
5,that are not really
5,something like that so
5,weve had a lot
5,although there is some
5,where he said that
5,because we dont know
5,dont even have to
5,it as you say
5,do it at the
5,both of those things
5,its going to turn
5,goes all the way
5,some people have a
5,said were going to
5,to let the market
5,on in the economy
5,to go on a
5,of the examples you
5,up to the point
5,with you about the
5,about the challenge of
5,years ago in the
5,going to sell it
5,going to be okay
5,i dont even think
5,have to pay to
5,middle of the 20th
5,that we dont understand
5,this idea that there
5,way of putting it
5,put the money in
5,i find strange about
5,are on the other
5,of the world to
5,you do if you
5,a lot of high
5,it gives you a
5,that people have to
5,ignore the fact that
5,is this going to
5,dont have any money
5,if you know the
5,means that there are
5,whether or not it
5,a lot of effort
5,if you tell me
5,solve the problem of
5,they wanted to get
5,ask you about the
5,in a sense the
5,is the author of
5,not just that there
5,dont think we need
5,a good idea because
5,that correct guest yeah
5,ill give you a
5,lot of people got
5,the way we would
5,of the changes in
5,guest well theres a
5,we are seeing is
5,that that kind of
5,fair to say that
5,monetary and financial system
5,this is the first
5,not saying this is
5,the senate and the
5,along the way the
5,in the development of
5,anything to say about
5,than any of the
5,to do it by
5,so i think weve
5,of the features of
5,be done about it
5,is in many ways
5,the people who like
5,want to figure out
5,the end of their
5,sleeping on the job
5,a lot over time
5,what you should do
5,they are working on
5,would lead to a
5,to do and i
5,thing that i think
5,this is that the
5,the person you are
5,the president and the
5,and then the last
5,can say is that
5,the feds balance sheet
5,of being in the
5,russ why is that
5,one and i think
5,know there are some
5,the fed has a
5,do if you are
5,was the fact that
5,think the more important
5,the late 18th century
5,to sell it for
5,that pays the most
5,and thats where we
5,how you look at
5,be able to figure
5,me to be a
5,of the cruelest things
5,rest of us are
5,for me is that
5,want the government to
5,the problems with that
5,is going to show
5,because as you point
5,the problem we are
5,has to be in
5,in the current situation
5,of one of those
5,live in montgomery county
5,off into the distance
5,of the problems is
5,how do they get
5,the social sciences and
5,there is no difference
5,are you trying to
5,you just take the
5,wed like it to
5,you cant get it
5,the social security system
5,we should be more
5,trying to understand the
5,are sitting in the
5,through the political process
5,the market value of
5,russ a little bit
5,we teach our students
5,what we can learn
5,get better and better
5,you had your druthers
5,but i wonder how
5,united states a lot
5,a world where its
5,so how does the
5,what i did in
5,going back to my
5,not in the book
5,give it to them
5,the way you do
5,in many different ways
5,able to get it
5,and when i was
5,who want to get
5,what it is now
5,the people who worked
5,which is to me
5,well talk about it
5,that we have more
5,i always think about
5,a role in the
5,a problem with the
5,guest the problem is
5,to happen to the
5,do the best you
5,the middle class is
5,that they would get
5,and maybe some of
5,the old days if
5,the war in iraq
5,thing that would be
5,still going to be
5,talk about how the
5,reminds me a little
5,to get on the
5,of where we are
5,thats kind of an
5,said this is the
5,if i think about
5,sitting in front of
5,not just because of
5,russ yeah its true
5,thank you very much
5,theres a number of
5,about that and then
5,a much more efficient
5,its hard to think
5,so carry on guest
5,but even in the
5,would be like a
5,said theres a lot
5,for the private sector
5,to solve a problem
5,on the east side
5,and it wont be
5,to reduce the probability
5,of the financial system
5,people say well we
5,the same way you
5,guest well yeah i
5,is determined by the
5,version of that is
5,im not saying we
5,in a much more
5,as the people who
5,looked at it and
5,so part of the
5,of one kind or
5,you look in the
5,its important that we
5,make some kind of
5,you just said is
5,people who didnt have
5,be better than the
5,very sympathetic to that
5,pulled out of the
5,fair trade movement is
5,you dont know how
5,then we have a
5,the entire financial system
5,people who have a
5,that people in the
5,from year to year
5,ask the question what
5,which is that people
5,of things that you
5,didnt have to worry
5,russ and some of
5,the ones in the
5,to do it through
5,and i thought this
5,to fannie and freddie
5,the same thing to
5,trying to assess the
5,there is absolutely no
5,the depth of the
5,people respond to incentives
5,to do it they
5,guest it was a
5,for more than it
5,but you could argue
5,and thats a very
5,you have a great
5,to start with some
5,authors of the study
5,if transactions costs are
5,want to understand the
5,take them out of
5,weve made a lot
5,health care system is
5,time to talk about
5,is that the more
5,right now they are
5,i do not think
5,on the quality of
5,that will help you
5,i cant sell it
5,if you think in
5,rate of growth in
5,to make the pie
5,this is i think
5,could not be more
5,the stimulus package and
5,the answer is because
5,and we dont do
5,we are taking a
5,and the opportunity to
5,whats going on the
5,is the reason why
5,put it that way
5,the 20th century and
5,i just dont like
5,that most of these
5,they are just not
5,what wed like to
5,i think he is
5,i was at the
5,russ right guest and
5,private equity and venture
5,believe that there are
5,you want to try
5,to do all the
5,and in fact we
5,on it i think
5,and you say i
5,one of the advantages
5,in order to build
5,but some of that
5,they dont get the
5,guest i want to
5,than a billion dollars
5,people thought it would
5,the one thing you
5,lets take the con
5,push back a little
5,the obedience of moral
5,out in the open
5,to play the game
5,a lot about what
5,is more of a
5,very clearly in the
5,looks like there is
5,in september of 2008
5,theme in the book
5,because i have a
5,you think we stand
5,and you can think
5,they try to do
5,most of it is
5,of all the different
5,the same thing they
5,its a very difficult
5,difficult it is to
5,back to that later
5,talking about the current
5,to get ahead of
5,we find that the
5,not everybody is going
5,being able to get
5,most people think of
5,way to do things
5,down the road guest
5,but i dont have
5,try to deal with
5,the causes of the
5,is it that you
5,the equation of exchange
5,you see it in
5,the ability to make
5,going to be sufficient
5,quite a bit more
5,sorts of things and
5,there may not be
5,a year or so
5,the central bank of
5,out a little bit
5,and for some reason
5,went back to the
5,who are good at
5,there is no evidence
5,right or wrong but
5,people who take the
5,rates are going to
5,we might think of
5,guest on the program
5,know what the answer
5,one argument is that
5,tens of billions of
5,people who work in
5,a good friend of
5,increase in the demand
5,the argument that i
5,think is the most
5,it the same way
5,what you said about
5,lot of money so
5,we should think about
5,so on so i
5,the time when they
5,its good to be
5,all of us have
5,to the banking system
5,been the case in
5,know anything about how
5,compared to what we
5,that but what i
5,and it was really
5,that much of what
5,discount rate should be
5,to be the dominant
5,we can say is
5,the same time that
5,to the possibility that
5,was quite a bit
5,to rely on the
5,idea is that if
5,you find out that
5,at the forefront of
5,on the internet that
5,you might be able
5,high rates of return
5,of them have to
5,the results have been
5,who has got a
5,to be put in
5,i wonder if you
5,saying this is a
5,it is that there
5,about why that is
5,it there are a
5,you can make more
5,any stretch of the
5,way people think about
5,have to make some
5,have to admit that
5,we can measure it
5,is part of that
5,the bank and the
5,get out of bed
5,in the world are
5,but the idea of
5,not only do we
5,hear what you are
5,be able to cover
5,do but i think
5,people out of poverty
5,as an economist i
5,had to deal with
5,as large as the
5,years to figure out
5,of my book is
5,of a better word
5,it what do you
5,be a big deal
5,in the washington dc
5,the discount rate and
5,a phd in economics
5,other stuff going on
5,would be if the
5,we could do this
5,and it really is
5,who dont go to
5,to act in the
5,see that kind of
5,way we are going
5,in a grocery store
5,getting more and more
5,things that have a
5,that seems to me
5,at the very top
5,can raise the price
5,think that it was
5,i want to live
5,in the last three
5,was just going to
5,we were one of
5,that the relationship between
5,i think what the
5,so when you have
5,a good thing for
5,youve got to look
5,come to the united
5,you asked me to
5,put them in the
5,if we could get
5,what they know and
5,to have that kind
5,lot of interest in
5,the fat tissue and
5,we have a sense
5,not so worried about
5,is only a small
5,are in the future
5,private property market economy
5,id love to get
5,their children and grandchildren
5,what weve been doing
5,form of lower wages
5,and see how they
5,thats a kind of
5,than the average person
5,because i think theres
5,and i say i
5,what you do in
5,it i think it
5,about what is the
5,financial sector and the
5,take the money and
5,and then there was
5,made a bunch of
5,in some ways the
5,russ its a very
5,take a shot at
5,going to be doing
5,to call it the
5,is you want to
5,better than the other
5,i went back and
5,crisis in the united
5,world would look like
5,thats because of the
5,need to spend more
5,even if they do
5,better than that and
5,in two ways one
5,and then you also
5,that i had to
5,feel the same way
5,which of course the
5,there are some very
5,we are having a
5,but there is an
5,for people to have
5,do that you are
5,the wrong side of
5,was not going to
5,but we also have
5,it back into the
5,spend the money on
5,there is not much
5,are looking at is
5,what are the odds
5,the people who lost
5,are going to reduce
5,from around the world
5,going to change your
5,and first of all
5,dont know if there
5,but of course we
5,said what do you
5,find out what the
5,out in terms of
5,the rise in the
5,the high end of
5,the early 19th century
5,all kinds of problems
5,russ so you have
5,its not a bad
5,for people who have
5,and you are also
5,more likely you are
5,to say that when
5,of the developed world
5,does it have to
5,do agree with you
5,is driven by the
5,where the money is
5,what the fed should
5,as hard as they
5,for example there is
5,see if you can
5,market is going to
5,where he talks about
5,a number of countries
5,two different kinds of
5,of china and india
5,so this is where
5,difference between the two
5,the back of our
5,of course they dont
5,view which is that
5,or not you are
5,the only people who
5,at the world and
5,there are a whole
5,to be confident that
5,as well and i
5,huge part of it
5,based on the idea
5,guest well thats right
5,low interest rates are
5,some of the issues
5,you look at whats
5,going to get you
5,all of it but
5,and what might be
5,some of those are
5,think there is no
5,and we should be
5,to the view that
5,people in the middle
5,you tell me that
5,who dont have a
5,now i have a
5,other countries dont have
5,is that when the
5,one is that you
5,it033 intro recording date
5,so you get a
5,that the rate of
5,they are making the
5,the only thing i
5,a good thing in
5,a good thing if
5,it means to be
5,i think is most
5,which is i dont
5,have an opportunity to
5,but if you ask
5,sense that they are
5,say we are not
5,lot more than that
5,see the same thing
5,is the only way
5,idea i think the
5,and in that sense
5,is the right one
5,you cant get out
5,so much that the
5,to think about when
5,is at this point
5,want to be careful
5,think they have a
5,and i thought that
5,and there are other
5,i am trying to
5,no matter what you
5,and go back to
5,i think you need
5,the united states not
5,the united states now
5,the supreme court has
5,in a small town
5,for the last 40
5,russ and do you
5,we talked earlier about
5,thats going to work
5,extended period of time
5,again i think the
5,rescue of bear stearns
5,all im saying is
5,you could look at
5,about this before on
5,i look to the
5,back to the 1970s
5,do something about this
5,make sure that they
5,when the time comes
5,one thing that was
5,we see lots of
5,as a proportion of
5,that thats the case
5,because i think that
5,the quantity theory of
5,and the third thing
5,the power to make
5,for a very very
5,in the power of
5,that the money is
5,i think you make
5,who are used to
5,an increase in government
5,in the economy or
5,in a few years
5,on the democratic side
5,are people out there
5,you are making that
5,is really going to
5,and so these are
5,in the heads of
5,make it a little
5,over the last several
5,that were supposed to
5,whats the best way
5,into some of the
5,not going to talk
5,and all of them
5,we have right now
5,about these kind of
5,that kind of behavior
5,it was a great
5,a number of factors
5,like to hear from
5,the world russ yeah
5,and so you know
5,policy in order to
5,make sure you dont
5,austrian theory of the
5,now its true that
5,to go to war
5,one of those people
5,it will continue to
5,about it this way
5,way you think about
5,guest i would say
5,of all possible worlds
5,you dont like it
5,a sharp increase in
5,in the space of
5,to make it and
5,if you put a
5,is that they were
5,its not the case
5,are very different from
5,understand that they are
5,do is to get
5,at the high school
5,of reaction have you
5,its not the whole
5,we do is we
5,ways of doing things
5,that he was the
5,there wont be a
5,knocking on the door
5,you are probably right
5,them to do that
5,the same time if
5,even if they were
5,to where they are
5,go to the bank
5,people would argue that
5,they do have a
5,whats the point of
5,and the need to
5,as i understand it
5,as well as i
5,won the lottery and
5,people they are not
5,you think thats going
5,and a little more
5,guest well it was
5,even though it might
5,we should do is
5,the last thing you
5,economy is going to
5,answer is i dont
5,we would want to
5,think of it in
5,interact with each other
5,were in the middle
5,be on the program
5,dont know exactly what
5,a lot of experiments
5,of the world the
5,the problems we have
5,thats kind of what
5,on the kind of
5,its just not a
5,a little bit do
5,for the reason you
5,people who can do
5,what has happened is
5,the way we usually
5,that and talk about
5,where there was a
5,the only thing thats
5,want to sit on
5,to some extent by
5,but we dont want
5,to sell the horse
5,to get a free
5,the best of the
5,every one of those
5,are many ways in
5,because it will be
5,in the local service
5,used to be i
5,its not necessarily the
5,wed like to know
5,at the personal level
5,that i need to
5,turns out thats not
5,in the data and
5,in the year 2000
5,can debate whether thats
5,the rest of society
5,is we should be
5,very little to do
5,in a time of
5,couldnt agree with you
5,be the result of
5,have a tough time
5,states a lot of
5,of the problem i
5,in the book when
5,im not sure we
5,to that and i
5,a while but i
5,you are saying and
5,is a world where
5,million and a half
5,and so what happens
5,even to the extent
5,at this point is
5,me say it a
5,so in the united
5,i find it remarkable
5,to be done in
5,to make lots of
5,many of our listeners
5,to the interests of
5,of life is to
5,of looking at it
5,growth rate in the
5,in the public school
5,going to grow at
5,to have a large
5,doesnt have any effect
5,you see as the
5,of the time is
5,in the same boat
5,that strikes me as
5,of the insights of
5,about what was going
5,it starts with the
5,how big is it
5,you wouldnt be able
5,and hes going to
5,was a situation where
5,theres a very large
5,start to see the
5,going to put you
5,were going to keep
5,thought that that was
5,burden of the debt
5,where we are now
5,are talking about that
5,the fight of the
5,but in this case
5,for the average american
5,or one of the
5,but on the whole
5,wouldnt want to argue
5,a while back and
5,you are not on
5,to give us the
5,is what you would
5,able to change the
5,is the key to
5,to do it on
5,and of course many
5,of course we have
5,and other parts of
5,we have a little
5,the job that pays
5,at george mason u
5,to do that would
5,fannie and freddie to
5,in the game is
5,back to that because
5,dont go to college
5,i actually think the
5,believe that there is
5,even though they were
5,a majority of the
5,in the future russ
5,there is a role
5,of it but the
5,and i like to
5,if you make it
5,figure out how you
5,going to get in
5,the performance of the
5,at that time and
5,much less than the
5,do you get the
5,said the same thing
5,when you say they
5,what we might think
5,to live their lives
5,to do to get
5,now the question is
5,the way its not
5,you and me and
5,because i dont have
5,are going to ask
5,in any case i
5,one kind or another
5,an inquiry into the
5,the way you want
5,not an expert in
5,to think about them
5,you dont agree with
5,that you dont get
5,that if you could
5,i would say in
5,of the drug companies
5,it up a little
5,and we know the
5,we dont fully understand
5,how long you live
5,can look at it
5,i started thinking about
5,lot of people from
5,so if there is
5,on that kind of
5,a fraction of what
5,up on the web
5,in our standard of
5,to try to measure
5,is going to continue
5,second part of the
5,is a very large
5,difficult for them to
5,more to it than
5,monetary policy and i
5,and i should say
5,to work with the
5,going to go on
5,you might as well
5,the real world and
5,and not just a
5,fannie and freddie the
5,with the best of
5,so you take a
5,of i think the
5,i dont really think
5,and thats true of
5,to do it you
5,many of the most
5,as if there is
5,versus the control group
5,for it in the
5,get what you pay
5,not one of them
5,expect to see a
5,united states we dont
5,but you are making
5,what the source of
5,institute of health nih
5,russ well one of
5,are talking about so
5,fact that a lot
5,in the virtual world
5,example there is a
5,there will be no
5,no question that the
5,but i think one
5,change in the way
5,one of the important
5,a world where i
5,for a minute about
5,it makes a big
5,when you are unemployed
5,that does not mean
5,things you could do
5,ways in which you
5,two things first of
5,back into the past
5,say no no no
5,you a lot of
5,last 10 or 15
5,what could we do
5,he didnt think that
5,a lot of human
5,be worth a lot
5,what you really want
5,be thought of as
5,to do is just
5,and the other was
5,of the time i
5,number of jobs and
5,is a sign of
5,middle of nowhere and
5,i think is part
5,the kind of person
5,what they are actually
5,russ so lets take
5,the answer is i
5,to stick with the
5,a long way toward
5,the basis of that
5,but not very much
5,youd be willing to
5,its okay to steal
5,set of rules that
5,and that part of
5,if you are lucky
5,what you do with
5,theres an argument for
5,fact that theres a
5,is the way to
5,the way its been
5,before on the program
5,happened in the last
5,youd think that would
5,reduces the number of
5,but in fact the
5,in some parts of
5,another part of the
5,where there is an
5,people want to have
5,life of its own
5,when you and i
5,both the left and
5,even if we are
5,to understand whats going
5,pay any attention to
5,the money supply in
5,we do in the
5,that the idea of
5,want to get it
5,but its going to
5,lot of changes in
5,well but i think
5,i dont think those
5,are going to destroy
5,very good job and
5,im not sure they
5,issue which is the
5,guest right so the
5,they dont get it
5,so at some point
5,of that and i
5,even if you had
5,that but thats a
5,to solve these problems
5,you point out if
5,there was going to
5,been a lot more
5,in my book is
5,its easy for me
5,were all going to
5,all these people who
5,so it can be
5,health care in the
5,this is a book
5,is no way to
5,if you ask me
5,right now is that
5,have to ask yourself
5,that was my next
5,the manipulation of money
5,you might call it
5,i want to stop
5,you make the claim
5,or the other and
5,because i think this
5,if you cant do
5,things like that russ
5,are willing to give
5,of the stuff that
5,the midst of the
5,a huge impact on
5,higher than it is
5,have no doubt that
5,more than that and
5,go to a restaurant
5,russ now when you
5,lot of interesting things
5,we think about it
5,where we are right
5,economies of scale that
5,was done in the
5,but we know that
5,down a lot of
5,be off the table
5,and the head of
5,but its interesting that
5,the difference between what
5,could go on and
5,the test of time
5,its not something you
5,saying is that if
5,all the time we
5,the sense that if
5,is true that the
5,in cases where it
5,of the reason its
5,be very difficult to
5,of the ability to
5,in which you have
5,of what you call
5,if the fed had
5,we could do it
5,and we can talk
5,prison or jail than
5,could be the case
5,well be talking about
5,a few years back
5,to give it to
5,and it is not
5,the gold standard was
5,the top down and
5,of the state of
5,you think about what
5,of winning the lottery
5,a big deal but
5,that you are right
5,the first one to
5,hundred years from now
5,the government needs to
5,out in the last
5,of my favorite examples
5,a matter of the
5,as well but i
5,the owners of the
5,than it is worth
5,lets close talking about
5,have to pay them
5,thing to look at
5,get to the point
5,i think that even
5,in the auto industry
5,a bunch of money
5,and its not the
5,who want to do
5,and he would say
5,at least they are
5,the view that the
5,at the numbers and
5,the great thing about
5,we can see the
5,would love to see
5,them what to do
5,i would be happy
5,and they are the
5,i would add to
5,the first thing i
5,never be able to
5,the only thing we
5,there will be people
5,they had a lot
5,interest rates and the
5,foundations of economic analysis
5,up to the level
5,you can learn from
5,doesnt necessarily mean that
5,you have to build
5,else is going to
5,when you go back
5,the shadow banking system
5,it would be wrong
5,little bit more about
5,to get back on
5,we should talk about
5,going back into the
5,of human nature and
5,of these things is
5,than what we are
5,make everybody better off
5,a little harder to
5,they were before the
5,picking winners and losers
5,by far the most
5,we are seeing a
5,it but thats not
5,on the web you
5,any of the other
5,to be in charge
5,in my mind is
5,if we go to
5,the financial crisis is
5,this in terms of
5,the basic idea is
5,we are out of
5,impact of the project
5,back in the 1970s
5,you were to take
5,so the people who
5,and i would like
5,you are just going
5,it takes to be
5,im going to use
5,then there is no
5,think about it the
5,to make it look
5,ive come to believe
5,of the price of
5,the future and i
5,flip side of that
5,interesting and i think
5,lot of time thinking
5,dont think thats true
5,that big a deal
5,is more likely to
5,was going to work
5,have to ask what
5,a billion dollars in
5,most if not all
5,that is the reason
5,was in graduate school
5,the reason i think
5,want to be paid
5,that i can get
5,i do that i
5,of it as the
5,of that im not
5,good for you and
5,to figure out a
5,come back to your
5,is youve got to
5,to do and what
5,there are only two
5,as a whole is
5,was one of these
5,but in a way
5,what we know from
5,guest and so what
5,3 and a half
5,as you just said
5,its a really interesting
5,a difference between the
5,has an impact on
5,thats a lot more
5,current population survey cps
5,guest the fact that
5,the university of chicago
5,in the new world
5,i just think thats
5,you get a very
5,point is that it
5,the ability to do
5,open the door to
5,but there have been
5,is not a great
5,a way to think
5,and i came to
5,but i was struck
5,that you are getting
5,trying to make the
5,important to understand that
5,that monetary policy has
5,in many ways its
5,let me back up
5,ties in with the
5,human action but not
5,about it but the
5,being paid by the
5,dont disagree with you
5,and they have an
5,the equivalent of the
5,a little bit higher
5,when you use the
5,more of the same
5,argue that in the
5,small amount of money
5,more than just the
5,that the main thing
5,you are an autocrat
5,the first couple of
5,there will be more
5,and so the way
5,but he was a
5,and we had a
5,people of the world
5,not just that the
5,a book about the
5,easy for you to
5,than it is now
5,like you and i
5,they should be doing
5,are part of this
5,you are probably going
5,about it and then
5,agree with that russ
5,in which case you
5,do something about the
5,its not a secret
5,this gets back to
5,the time it takes
5,and i talk about
5,have a quote from
5,to take one example
5,that is supposed to
5,when we go to
5,dramatically in the last
5,in my view and
5,and i dont really
5,it would make a
5,and in some sense
5,what really matters is
5,what you were saying
5,become more and more
5,lot of people and
5,the idea behind the
5,about how do we
5,hayek the curious task
5,if we dont like
5,is were going to
5,adam smith in the
5,when we get to
5,the people who make
5,can and cannot do
5,lending to each other
5,dont want it to
5,going to be at
5,i think what is
5,would have been very
5,it turned out they
5,i have to admit
5,say anything else about
5,because there was no
5,never going to get
5,in terms of being
5,people who go on
5,trying to help them
5,themes of the book
5,other way to think
5,take the con out
5,would make a good
5,correlation is not causation
5,of it but it
5,talk about that because
5,can get in the
5,the high school dropout
5,was going to go
5,it was the result
5,least for a while
5,is that he was
5,because i dont know
5,how do we do
5,go a little deeper
5,didnt finish high school
5,low end of the
5,all of human history
5,to speak to the
5,of the human mind
5,can be reduced to
5,green pieces of paper
5,to be paid in
5,but that was the
5,i think i can
5,the next two years
5,all these things are
5,no one is in
5,the question of how
5,dont care about the
5,in front of him
5,are parts of the
5,question to ask is
5,going to hurt the
5,to create a system
5,of the time what
5,people in the profession
5,that if you really
5,what the fed does
5,doesnt care if you
5,of the use of
5,a time when we
5,sell something for more
5,but its not as
5,going to be bailed
5,there for a long
5,a very large fraction
5,i just find it
5,we seem to have
5,part of the us
5,the kind of people
5,less than the value
5,i dont see a
5,on and on about
5,view and i think
5,it is but i
5,to be better off
5,the same way the
5,right now there are
5,have a great deal
5,the interest rate that
5,and theres no reason
5,how you measure it
5,to make decisions about
5,very very hard to
5,fda food and drug
5,that people dont know
5,to do is the
5,because there are all
5,in the classroom and
5,you are working on
5,for the great depression
5,be one of those
5,but what they do
5,problems that are not
5,its better to have
5,russ yeah and i
5,why is that the
5,on whether or not
5,russ yeah but i
5,something for more than
5,it was easier to
5,the real issue is
5,it and so they
5,we can debate whether
5,when you see a
5,dont care about that
5,to be seen as
5,the breast cancer 3days
5,you might have a
5,want to stick with
5,i dont see how
5,the story of how
5,of a sudden its
5,this is the best
5,the efficient market model
5,two ways to get
5,a way that makes
5,was an attempt to
5,if you come up
5,parts of it that
5,as if by an
5,that to be a
5,as an economist is
5,little to do with
5,let me ask it
5,in the fashion world
5,more people are going
5,it did in the
5,people dont have the
5,to understand what the
5,if you are thinking
5,the only thing they
5,what the rules of
5,of not being able
5,that this kind of
5,but at least they
5,you were at the
5,dont know whether that
5,thats not the point
5,80 million dollar loan
5,the case that a
5,but there are some
5,going to buy it
5,seems like a very
5,government has to step
5,at least according to
5,when i was doing
5,for the doctor to
5,there isnt going to
5,of the view that
5,i wanted to go
5,the food and drug
5,want to keep their
5,over the last century
5,you dont really want
5,the world that are
5,dont think we know
5,were going to sell
5,if you start to
5,you would want to
5,what i talk about
5,can come in and
5,executive officer ceo of
5,on the same side
5,thats why they are
5,to tell a story
5,to go to law
5,and you would have
5,little bit of money
5,go on to college
5,was very clear that
5,and i say that
5,so you think about
5,is the only thing
5,and i just want
5,came up in a
5,sounds like you are
5,had a lot to
5,a better place and
5,appears to be a
5,not only is it
5,make it easier to
5,if you think its
5,is the opposite of
5,that i think most
5,figured out a way
5,look at it as
5,as you said in
5,all kinds of different
5,so weve got to
5,division of labor and
5,is what are the
5,out how it is
5,that would change the
5,out of control and
5,well they are not
5,dont really care about
5,feel like they are
5,we want people to
5,which i think you
5,whats your assessment of
5,you have a situation
5,going to be just
5,able to come up
5,and so i would
5,running a balanced budget
5,but its a pretty
5,later in the book
5,the standard argument is
5,in a few weeks
5,bank of america and
5,at any one point
5,are stuck with the
5,in its own right
5,are arguing that the
5,about the soviet union
5,and what we might
5,is that you will
5,are some of those
5,dont have to sell
5,them to go out
5,it takes a lot
5,lot of this is
5,to see what happens
5,if i tell you
5,dont think it has
5,whats happening is that
5,the failure of the
5,you get from the
5,drag on the economy
5,was published in the
5,you can do in
5,people who do not
5,i would say no
5,going to go do
5,i find it interesting
5,for fannie and freddie
5,i dont remember the
5,are working for the
5,youd think people would
5,you are unable to
5,and in fact i
5,there are people like
5,people who say they
5,the gold standard and
5,right way to say
5,20 years from now
5,if there were more
5,so it turns out
5,of paying interest on
5,is going to push
5,about the financial sector
5,over the last two
5,the total number of
5,thing to do that
5,but its the same
5,i had a little
5,keeping an eye on
5,a particular kind of
5,right i dont think
5,end of the 1930s
5,want to mention to
5,one thing that struck
5,as you say there
5,to pay back the
5,who wins and who
5,for that in the
5,look at the actual
5,i assume there are
5,hard to think about
5,in any of the
5,to try to improve
5,long enough to see
5,to do it better
5,economic consequences of the
5,is if you think
5,a percentage of gdp
5,by the time he
5,incentive to try to
5,guest yeah exactly and
5,i point out in
5,you would expect to
5,trying to understand how
5,other is that the
5,look at it its
5,a hell of a
5,the point that you
5,i dont want you
5,be a problem in
5,that we have is
5,to get us to
5,to be doing that
5,much lower than the
5,something wrong with the
5,with respect to what
5,going to worry about
5,lot of stuff in
5,what does that have
5,its a great story
5,im trying to say
5,so as you point
5,at least in terms
4,of the magnitude of
4,way i think that
4,those out of the
4,and of itself russ
4,it wouldnt surprise me
4,the things i like
4,the price goes up
4,wants them to do
4,and theres lots of
4,is this is the
4,hayek was not a
4,transactions costs are sufficiently
4,enemy of the good
4,nothing to say about
4,in some sense and
4,and this is very
4,if we hadnt had
4,so for me the
4,all those things are
4,should be more like
4,might have been in
4,but its clear that
4,or not at all
4,went up a lot
4,to be nice to
4,to put in the
4,and this kind of
4,late 1950s early 1960s
4,things like that its
4,and the difference between
4,we are spending a
4,is i have a
4,and those sorts of
4,can think about the
4,at one of the
4,for people to work
4,the price of something
4,aftermath of the 2008
4,you are right its
4,were talking about a
4,you dont see a
4,i mean i dont
4,them have to do
4,well talk about the
4,what i would argue
4,in the interests of
4,the right things to
4,it in the context
4,problem is the way
4,think thats a real
4,about that guest i
4,thats the way that
4,and they have the
4,the captain of the
4,much is due to
4,are going to win
4,where they are and
4,things that you know
4,is i think it
4,it and so i
4,quantity theory of money
4,that has a very
4,lot of reasons for
4,of the issues you
4,in the world where
4,there are not many
4,guest and so i
4,in which they are
4,didnt think about it
4,in order to really
4,i dont really understand
4,about how to get
4,but for the most
4,have been done in
4,do is the thing
4,question what is the
4,i know that i
4,then you get into
4,dont have the knowledge
4,it gives me the
4,have to take into
4,in the late 1950s
4,the internal revenue service
4,of the revolving door
4,think it is true
4,to tell you how
4,how to make that
4,but in the late
4,a lot of difference
4,people would like to
4,said we dont know
4,the points i make
4,have changed the way
4,both of us are
4,that they ought to
4,ten years from now
4,similar to what the
4,your book is a
4,give you one example
4,to the current system
4,that they use to
4,rosen and ed lazear
4,was that the banks
4,pushing up the demand
4,have a very large
4,to think that this
4,stearns and lehman brothers
4,economists and political scientists
4,in advance of experience
4,people in our society
4,and take care of
4,has a lot more
4,explain whats going on
4,you listen to econtalk
4,are a lot lower
4,and the first thing
4,to get together and
4,i believe that there
4,because as you say
4,ago there was a
4,a credit default swap
4,if i have to
4,in each of those
4,through a series of
4,we need a different
4,and of course one
4,guest yeah let me
4,going to happen but
4,im worried about the
4,they didnt get the
4,for it out of
4,with the state of
4,to convince people that
4,i think is true
4,not big enough to
4,well we have to
4,in what they are
4,theyre going to have
4,one of the criticisms
4,so now you have
4,are happier than poor
4,the origin of life
4,want to have that
4,to answer those questions
4,the question i think
4,about the idea of
4,same people over time
4,and there has been
4,mean by that guest
4,to ask you is
4,time one of the
4,would be that if
4,the market price in
4,of the industrial revolution
4,so part of what
4,i mean if you
4,seen a lot of
4,elsewhere in the world
4,you argue that the
4,people working in the
4,out and buy a
4,im sure you are
4,out the people who
4,the point that there
4,in the public debate
4,dont have skin in
4,your point of view
4,what you call a
4,is not due to
4,what people are doing
4,who have a very
4,of most of the
4,to what i was
4,better than the alternative
4,for the state in
4,thing you want to
4,guest you have to
4,would say its not
4,the be all and
4,so these are things
4,been a good thing
4,of a number of
4,that is trying to
4,on how to think
4,at a rate of
4,the pie is not
4,i used to say
4,when the price of
4,you have a small
4,but even in that
4,so you and i
4,pay enough attention to
4,a lot easier to
4,period of time which
4,the way to get
4,is a complex system
4,so the kind of
4,goldman sachs jp morgan
4,of the shadow banking
4,and its not because
4,are an economist you
4,in so many ways
4,of how much of
4,by jp morgan chase
4,going to start to
4,long time in the
4,but if there are
4,checks and balances are
4,so it wasnt that
4,look back on the
4,and thats why it
4,as many people to
4,there wont be any
4,that allows people to
4,the political forces that
4,of what happens to
4,many people who have
4,that in spite of
4,this is exactly the
4,this is a big
4,this is what is
4,and the only thing
4,is not one of
4,people really want to
4,trillion dollars worth of
4,over time if you
4,a system that is
4,have to give them
4,its going to increase
4,of them are going
4,going to do russ
4,will continue to be
4,need to be careful
4,the enemy of the
4,to make the decision
4,they are pretty good
4,that we now have
4,try to get at
4,going to happen guest
4,third of the population
4,of your own money
4,how can you possibly
4,cant think of any
4,it was really a
4,it and they are
4,and the rest is
4,be part of it
4,do this there are
4,economy in terms of
4,lot of people but
4,way thats better for
4,a million dollars a
4,it so talk about
4,thats all there is
4,we have all the
4,what appear to be
4,jp morgan chase was
4,get up in the
4,very similar to what
4,be much of a
4,thats a very interesting
4,least a little bit
4,let me see if
4,a question of how
4,you cant deny the
4,still dont have a
4,most people do not
4,that they are able
4,overpay for lottery tickets
4,a small fraction of
4,of money out of
4,the reason they do
4,hard to find a
4,what they were trying
4,of all let me
4,everyone is trying to
4,now it is true
4,in the keynesian model
4,to know if you
4,part of the market
4,that you dont do
4,we get wealthier we
4,find it strange that
4,if you dont get
4,need to try to
4,but he had a
4,are better than others
4,the idea that each
4,but when you get
4,be a group of
4,he wanted to do
4,united states and its
4,are doing a lot
4,a skeptic about that
4,thousands of years ago
4,injected into the economy
4,much as we want
4,at least in theory
4,work one of the
4,of economics at the
4,in the human body
4,and everything else and
4,being an obvious example
4,dont think thats what
4,of different types of
4,to talk about how
4,its fair to say
4,isnt enough to go
4,i think that some
4,an argument that is
4,on the job so
4,that its the same
4,to do it this
4,of the book for
4,do you think theres
4,we have too many
4,you can do to
4,we dont want them
4,on what is happening
4,its exactly the same
4,think you need to
4,you think might be
4,problem if you are
4,they are not investing
4,a little different than
4,he is talking about
4,there has never been
4,i dont know im
4,to understand how it
4,going to say we
4,is very much a
4,different from what the
4,graduate from high school
4,an important thing to
4,we all try to
4,weve talked about many
4,of the left and
4,russ so for me
4,point which you make
4,in the book for
4,of it and so
4,that sense i think
4,the future and that
4,back on the gold
4,people buy and sell
4,to be going to
4,and the reason he
4,with the passage of
4,well were going to
4,on behalf of their
4,but in the meanwhile
4,should read this book
4,all and end all
4,it turns out thats
4,in the way he
4,example i like to
4,and therefore you have
4,of standing for freedom
4,we are likely to
4,and so he wanted
4,the marginal cost controversy
4,they go to a
4,it this way i
4,you have skin in
4,president has to sign
4,out of business or
4,the estimates of the
4,for all sorts of
4,for it and i
4,about on the program
4,it guest thats right
4,then of course the
4,they will continue to
4,not going to look
4,a country that has
4,the minimum wage which
4,to be ashamed of
4,makes you feel good
4,will be worse off
4,you say we have
4,is that in any
4,well i think they
4,a great deal to
4,are talking about what
4,in america at the
4,people like to talk
4,a lot of conservatives
4,the yuan is undervalued
4,we talk about people
4,if it were true
4,the great depression because
4,not just a matter
4,fannie and freddie and
4,the case that there
4,that we know that
4,say what do you
4,what was the impact
4,would be if they
4,only going to get
4,about the evolution of
4,anything that we can
4,to help poor people
4,going to take you
4,what about this and
4,for the economy to
4,if you want it
4,at a lower price
4,you ask them what
4,sheet of the fed
4,somebody who is not
4,out how much of
4,they should have had
4,are lots and lots
4,and giving it to
4,i just think we
4,mention by the way
4,saying this is the
4,if thats true i
4,dont see the evidence
4,i think is useful
4,of those kind of
4,we know how much
4,and over again in
4,to do it the
4,in terms of productivity
4,there are no good
4,do to try to
4,that no one else
4,russ well i have
4,of money i think
4,to do is increase
4,going to take us
4,response to that guest
4,we are really talking
4,with your friends and
4,think its worse than
4,happen to think that
4,at the root of
4,about what they should
4,do that we are
4,the political process to
4,and thats true but
4,going to take some
4,couple of reasons one
4,a million and a
4,so you are talking
4,they know and dont
4,you are a journalist
4,the things you learn
4,are going to hit
4,in some ways a
4,thats i think the
4,if you increase the
4,what it can do
4,have to go up
4,the very fact that
4,we could find a
4,you have to eat
4,in the medical profession
4,any more and so
4,you want to hear
4,but over the years
4,but we do need
4,as you can get
4,way to try to
4,is that the government
4,unlikely to be able
4,one of my friends
4,to a lesser extent
4,so on i think
4,that isnt going to
4,would be for the
4,assets of bear stearns
4,he wasnt the first
4,that the head of
4,we looked at the
4,there guest i think
4,the face of that
4,me that there is
4,well come back and
4,how do you decide
4,that many people have
4,at the hoover institution
4,of it i dont
4,15 years or so
4,so where does that
4,that could be part
4,one part of that
4,and the potential for
4,i find fascinating about
4,of that its a
4,the world works and
4,i get to do
4,i have tried to
4,the book you have
4,the economy if you
4,its the people who
4,for example if i
4,in terms of just
4,the power of markets
4,are not willing to
4,whose job it is
4,look back on it
4,have to control for
4,when we are not
4,that they are so
4,there will be many
4,to focus on that
4,it had been in
4,back to what you
4,guest and then the
4,and i think of
4,got to look at
4,a large body of
4,boards of directors of
4,to it of course
4,the upper east side
4,be much more difficult
4,in the cost of
4,do a pretty good
4,then you are going
4,so i had a
4,think its appropriate to
4,even when we are
4,the amount of work
4,the classic example of
4,guest i used to
4,whats your view on
4,its like to be
4,and it may have
4,the same problem in
4,going to be cheaper
4,so what you need
4,i didnt know about
4,give you a little
4,and no one else
4,united states so the
4,you look at economic
4,on the world economy
4,is the best way
4,the way you might
4,going to get away
4,and so that would
4,other things that you
4,the uncertainty about the
4,a lot more equity
4,health care and health
4,and this is really
4,on the program but
4,difference between that and
4,one of the characteristics
4,how little they know
4,of people who get
4,all these kinds of
4,how we might get
4,are talking about of
4,why interest rates are
4,back to the early
4,its the equivalent of
4,its the other way
4,lot of problems that
4,of the fed i
4,if you tell people
4,all of them were
4,to make money on
4,make our lives better
4,well get back to
4,the sense of what
4,thats a measure of
4,balance of payments crisis
4,and you spend a
4,lot of them have
4,going to assume that
4,and a sense of
4,we dont even know
4,were starting to see
4,that that was not
4,3 months from now
4,when we try to
4,them in the same
4,the reasons why the
4,order to make sure
4,was the first person
4,make sure that we
4,we have more than
4,turns out there are
4,that would be wrong
4,in the world have
4,guest well if we
4,why all of these
4,than they want to
4,why you think that
4,what happens when the
4,should have had a
4,in the unemployment rate
4,cities in the united
4,and if you wanted
4,guest yes russ its
4,so they want to
4,they dont know how
4,to me a lot
4,this has to do
4,the value of money
4,the united states certainly
4,of the key things
4,make it look like
4,the u of minnesota
4,has to be on
4,just to give you
4,it as a kind
4,we have a certain
4,the efficient markets hypothesis
4,the next four years
4,you tend to be
4,that makes you feel
4,that would be that
4,that it makes the
4,is not as good
4,one size fits all
4,can go out and
4,i try to be
4,in some ways is
4,that we use to
4,the civil war and
4,they might be able
4,earlier part of the
4,we didnt have the
4,think about the world
4,that doesnt get talked
4,old enough to remember
4,and they do it
4,take account of the
4,and you will have
4,the way of course
4,know that if you
4,story you just told
4,theres a possibility that
4,world was coming to
4,what they do thats
4,but i tend to
4,i kind of like
4,wanted to ask you
4,russ so how does
4,look at it is
4,to a system of
4,this is another thing
4,the federal reserve act
4,on so i think
4,been in the past
4,they are certainly not
4,at the number of
4,there is now a
4,to contribute to the
4,what i say is
4,id like to talk
4,the labor demand curve
4,rather than relying on
4,reaction have you gotten
4,russ what does that
4,and then lets talk
4,our present difficulty is
4,they do their best
4,guest oh yeah russ
4,to think about guest
4,a lot of peoples
4,have been a few
4,little bit about that
4,a minute but i
4,i thought about it
4,a point of view
4,in this case they
4,doesnt exist any more
4,to explain to people
4,book there are a
4,think you can get
4,of the rule of
4,they dont know that
4,are the ones we
4,doesnt matter if its
4,that people are more
4,and the fed is
4,in the tech sector
4,be able to handle
4,and i think again
4,list of things that
4,but what i find
4,which is called the
4,i was on the
4,the rest of my
4,the rules that govern
4,and if they did
4,talked about some of
4,have to trust the
4,is another way of
4,they could do a
4,of all its a
4,this which is the
4,of the black swan
4,a very short time
4,but there is certainly
4,will be people who
4,of it so we
4,to work very well
4,than there used to
4,think thats what the
4,any thoughts on that
4,so that they could
4,people would say thats
4,you see on the
4,because thats the only
4,say that we dont
4,more and more goods
4,my experience has been
4,standard of living that
4,the view that we
4,to do would be
4,you know when you
4,to pay it in
4,the government would bail
4,red blood cells and
4,as a result it
4,the best and the
4,to do with our
4,its hard to argue
4,have to depend on
4,of the united kingdom
4,are talking about when
4,to you when you
4,proportion of the population
4,what the world would
4,great depression as well
4,of them and then
4,the companies that are
4,there is a second
4,have roughly the same
4,thought that it was
4,we dont know whether
4,by the us government
4,one of the strangest
4,income in the united
4,its not good for
4,we have a bunch
4,its a wonderful thing
4,the shoulders of giants
4,for me i think
4,russ so its not
4,of the data that
4,somebody who is very
4,who do you think
4,go to a doctor
4,is and this is
4,and then when we
4,said that it was
4,much of an effect
4,but in order to
4,comes back to your
4,which of course has
4,and i just dont
4,increase the number of
4,that in some ways
4,where you dont have
4,we are thinking about
4,why this is a
4,we know we are
4,the answer is it
4,there are not enough
4,as soon as they
4,require a lot of
4,of uncertainty about the
4,that this would be
4,to make up the
4,be aware of the
4,need to change the
4,say it might be
4,the violence trap and
4,anyone who wants to
4,you think it will
4,of the day the
4,is really a very
4,problem is is that
4,more than the market
4,you think this is
4,you cant help but
4,well if you dont
4,that i have in
4,the death of the
4,pay for it in
4,the other way you
4,interest rates are a
4,the case that you
4,that you talked about
4,are in a very
4,in a barter economy
4,about the general theory
4,around the united states
4,need the government to
4,are concerned about the
4,between success and failure
4,that we would need
4,but the real question
4,true by the way
4,that its wrong to
4,a good place to
4,that would be another
4,it is a great
4,that would allow them
4,this is something we
4,so there will be
4,talked about many times
4,is just the way
4,of the department of
4,would have said that
4,me see if i
4,i think they should
4,and i are not
4,the safety net and
4,thats going to take
4,worried that we are
4,a 2 inflation target
4,if they were not
4,that would allow us
4,system and i think
4,know what i mean
4,out of the goodness
4,the insights of the
4,to do this in
4,the social welfare state
4,that you are probably
4,by the way if
4,in riskier and riskier
4,that they are being
4,i know you do
4,the severity of the
4,do you think have
4,so the rest of
4,if they were in
4,but its better than
4,and these are the
4,dont know how thats
4,at that and say
4,i think thats exactly
4,and when they get
4,economic calculation in the
4,guest yeah so the
4,have to build a
4,in this book is
4,that if you start
4,much more able to
4,at the same price
4,was a big deal
4,at all of the
4,do you believe that
4,its part of our
4,and then after a
4,the allocation of capital
4,is im going to
4,and the control group
4,the mess we are
4,most likely to be
4,between law and legislation
4,of the fuel injector
4,question is how did
4,dont know a lot
4,from people on the
4,at the other extreme
4,in some sense this
4,the answer is you
4,talk about but i
4,on a case by
4,could be true but
4,when we say that
4,the books of the
4,again this is a
4,to fix it and
4,people dont want the
4,if a lot of
4,in favor of more
4,banks are going to
4,you are saying this
4,they can make more
4,but if they are
4,a lot out of
4,of new york and
4,are at the top
4,back and say well
4,quote from the book
4,a third of it
4,that youd want to
4,guest right and then
4,a nobel prize winner
4,for me to sell
4,a problem with that
4,my response to that
4,what he wanted to
4,to control for that
4,use of the term
4,we dont really have
4,had a set of
4,want to be seen
4,them are going to
4,if you have it
4,big part of it
4,science technology engineering and
4,so the government is
4,whats going on i
4,high as it was
4,the other side which
4,but it doesnt work
4,and that in turn
4,you care about the
4,stuff and i think
4,friedman and schwartz in
4,would you do if
4,it would take to
4,the reality of the
4,before i do i
4,to get us out
4,we talk about it
4,they dont have enough
4,sector and in the
4,used to be an
4,it and he said
4,dont know which way
4,people move in and
4,about 70 of the
4,even if they had
4,you have a limited
4,that guest well this
4,so what i think
4,lot of people they
4,back and forth so
4,how we are going
4,russ right guest but
4,to answer that question
4,got to do something
4,i totally agree guest
4,first year of the
4,were talking about this
4,of the class i
4,something more than that
4,they are and they
4,you have an incentive
4,so that you have
4,that was a bad
4,what i think of
4,way to improve the
4,i dont know you
4,is sort of what
4,so you might say
4,people didnt want to
4,fact that some of
4,here at the u
4,so there may be
4,going to have people
4,is that theres no
4,that the invisible hand
4,the point in the
4,well this is the
4,so im just going
4,so what we did
4,going all the way
4,we dont want you
4,so even if we
4,of the fathers of
4,in the repo market
4,that he was a
4,and it might be
4,we do the same
4,think about what is
4,because so many people
4,most people dont want
4,little bit but i
4,allow the government to
4,little bit different from
4,the things that he
4,a little skeptical of
4,thats right so the
4,very few people who
4,and why it is
4,to say i am
4,that the dollar is
4,right russ and i
4,to believe that its
4,a little bit russ
4,found that there was
4,just to take one
4,have come out of
4,but it might be
4,pay for it out
4,i think as you
4,the one that has
4,thats the first thing
4,and he said oh
4,so let me try
4,so you have an
4,going to pay the
4,into the top 1
4,im a little confused
4,i think is so
4,thats the problem we
4,high school dropout rate
4,what is sometimes called
4,and they dont get
4,going to learn that
4,what are the prospects
4,but you know the
4,in terms of number
4,how much money is
4,we ought to get
4,the time he was
4,of the sources of
4,even though i think
4,i actually think we
4,with a very different
4,has an incentive to
4,what they found was
4,for us to do
4,i have to get
4,they are they are
4,may not be so
4,back down to the
4,are probably not going
4,that and you are
4,it was the right
4,the increase in inequality
4,we think of the
4,thats why you dont
4,have a few minutes
4,is the quality of
4,talking about right now
4,and so that is
4,out of this is
4,right guest yeah thats
4,fiscal and monetary policy
4,are referring to the
4,who are at the
4,part of the fed
4,well you know i
4,that even when we
4,hear a lot about
4,thats the part i
4,do you reconcile that
4,that way and i
4,that we see the
4,90th percentile and the
4,of the ways to
4,because of the great
4,a lot of doctors
4,they are not working
4,in that direction but
4,aftermath of the crisis
4,the costs of the
4,if i make a
4,ones who want to
4,to say we need
4,some people have claimed
4,or some sort of
4,to do that he
4,seem to me to
4,wouldnt want to say
4,what about all the
4,down on the job
4,years you are going
4,way to make a
4,question is how do
4,long as we have
4,of a sudden we
4,long time and its
4,to pay the cost
4,and thats just not
4,of that and thats
4,find any evidence that
4,that there are ways
4,the power of this
4,the birth of the
4,that among young black
4,the political system to
4,the short run or
4,of them will have
4,that the political process
4,a situation where there
4,a good thing because
4,cant help but think
4,that it has been
4,millions of people in
4,the whole history of
4,how you get from
4,the ideas in the
4,effect of winning the
4,out of the 18th
4,it and we dont
4,is a way in
4,so you could say
4,and he had this
4,have to figure it
4,the internet is making
4,i couldnt agree with
4,is going to the
4,its clear that the
4,have to make that
4,are the easiest person
4,the success of the
4,is a waste of
4,and i think probably
4,so its not as
4,you take into account
4,one of the architects
4,to be found in
4,about the book and
4,is it just that
4,its hard to remember
4,pointed out that the
4,going to pay attention
4,what i wanted to
4,i think is going
4,the causal effect of
4,in the act of
4,money in the economy
4,we talk about a
4,lot more money than
4,something you talk about
4,the money and the
4,that other people are
4,that they have been
4,this book which is
4,russ well im going
4,as you said the
4,bear stearns was in
4,that i mean that
4,going back to a
4,and there could be
4,want to let you
4,the best example of
4,a major role in
4,able to show that
4,that is sort of
4,i mean this is
4,argument and i think
4,in the very short
4,re no no im
4,and so im not
4,in my own work
4,pay attention to it
4,if i can get
4,of that do you
4,about the potential for
4,in the economy by
4,may not be true
4,a little more time
4,and so on russ
4,you are likely to
4,as you said earlier
4,they are using the
4,thats what they say
4,its fascinating to me
4,that the question is
4,think that some of
4,have all of these
4,the guy with the
4,when you were talking
4,lets start with what
4,even if its a
4,its good for you
4,nuts and bolts of
4,from the premise that
4,20 of the profits
4,you are not suggesting
4,but what we do
4,that there may be
4,a theory of the
4,you can read it
4,the quality of a
4,with the rise of
4,really thought about it
4,well im not sure
4,measure the impact of
4,i would suggest that
4,way to get more
4,its really not the
4,what do you feel
4,idea that you could
4,guest and by the
4,i was an undergraduate
4,case that if you
4,i think you do
4,why do we think
4,in your fat tissue
4,sitting on a lot
4,let me ask the
4,you look at countries
4,just trying to do
4,for them to get
4,much faster than the
4,hard to know what
4,do with it its
4,while the market is
4,the answer to your
4,comes back to my
4,think about it guest
4,and the impact on
4,of the country where
4,where we need to
4,one thing that i
4,going to get that
4,there are better ways
4,havent thought about it
4,do not have to
4,and why you think
4,of the theory of
4,i think that probably
4,and the way i
4,and thats just the
4,have much to do
4,i dont know russ
4,the transformation of the
4,make that kind of
4,lets think about the
4,it seems to work
4,the matter is that
4,when it came out
4,is to some extent
4,know what is going
4,for the right to
4,want to make money
4,is too important to
4,they are very good
4,do that if you
4,to get the government
4,to mention by the
4,is there are a
4,think it could be
4,how many of the
4,and keep in mind
4,total amount of the
4,and say im not
4,we would have a
4,to lend money to
4,through all kinds of
4,i know that you
4,the federal reserve to
4,now is that the
4,going to stick with
4,this program in the
4,to the states and
4,all of the time
4,a higher level of
4,waste a lot of
4,exactly the same way
4,i accept your point
4,if we could find
4,over the world they
4,things that are fun
4,and thats where i
4,when they are going
4,the third thing that
4,of the reasons is
4,get the right answer
4,a lot of useful
4,an interesting question i
4,to the federal government
4,way for people to
4,to plan for the
4,and in many ways
4,in the wn he
4,it its not a
4,that were in the
4,you cant get rid
4,the sense that there
4,not only does it
4,sherwin rosen and ed
4,do the things that
4,thats a big problem
4,you make a distinction
4,or that they are
4,its a function of
4,of view of a
4,with the advent of
4,do people want to
4,and they say oh
4,you are saying if
4,at any given time
4,is that thats not
4,they made a lot
4,but there was no
4,going to go ahead
4,lack of a better
4,concise encyclopedia of economics
4,because thats what the
4,better way to do
4,it at the end
4,saw a lot of
4,so they tend to
4,time in the book
4,what is the evidence
4,we havent made much
4,is a very high
4,breaking up the banks
4,interest on those reserves
4,there was a real
4,to be a much
4,necessary but not sufficient
4,you that you are
4,dont have to take
4,of course many of
4,of the last century
4,important thing is that
4,way you look at
4,when you come to
4,one point in time
4,changed over time and
4,a little bit over
4,they would say they
4,a lot of small
4,so that i can
4,that i am a
4,capital in the economy
4,guest so its a
4,united states is the
4,so to some extent
4,many things that are
4,there are some other
4,so people who had
4,the current crisis is
4,their point of view
4,i think so i
4,to decide whether to
4,in the top 20
4,has to happen before
4,to figure out who
4,not surprising to me
4,guest no i dont
4,that to the extent
4,dont really need to
4,we like the idea
4,lot of money they
4,dont like the way
4,of the limits of
4,in all those cases
4,seem to be very
4,dont think we should
4,you wouldnt expect to
4,you can come up
4,as quickly as possible
4,it because they are
4,say that i dont
4,is it true in
4,for a while i
4,leading up to the
4,to a change in
4,is it that people
4,here in montgomery county
4,millions of people who
4,id like to think
4,can see that there
4,the logic of the
4,been happening to the
4,moral hazard problem is
4,for a high school
4,they think of it
4,any more because they
4,and so forth that
4,they can afford to
4,you point out and
4,way you want to
4,are out of control
4,the ones that had
4,you cant see it
4,the government increases its
4,what should they have
4,put it into a
4,the other part that
4,it very difficult for
4,a way that they
4,many parts of the
4,thats the only way
4,ive been talking about
4,the adam smith problem
4,but there is another
4,to it which is
4,what he would call
4,then you had to
4,united states they are
4,didnt think it was
4,the interest rate is
4,why do you want
4,and then the rest
4,and we try to
4,can do is we
4,and so we should
4,ill tell you what
4,guest there was a
4,under a lot of
4,been talking about in
4,what you want is
4,have to turn to
4,is also going to
4,is something like that
4,i happen to be
4,you are doing this
4,could get away with
4,one of the top
4,you get to keep
4,you wrote for the
4,is just one of
4,is at least in
4,domestic product gdp or
4,agree with what you
4,and are going to
4,are in a world
4,all of that is
4,when they are looking
4,the current system and
4,on your own so
4,united states compared to
4,trying to do something
4,about and i think
4,be an interesting thing
4,a bad idea but
4,ways in which they
4,was born in memphis
4,not going to vote
4,heres where i think
4,of the political system
4,something to that but
4,to change the rules
4,italy and spain are
4,the other half of
4,constitution of liberty he
4,the extent that it
4,which is that there
4,it was easy to
4,you would need to
4,say well i dont
4,seems to have a
4,would have been in
4,what they are looking
4,marginal tax rates went
4,things like that the
4,consumption in the future
4,the edge of town
4,the root cause of
4,and how is that
4,a piece of the
4,the price system to
4,so that we could
4,make sure they have
4,little bit better and
4,lot of people get
4,current health care system
4,because they know that
4,you could argue its
4,correlation between population density
4,they are doing better
4,and we found that
4,theres lots of things
4,if we need to
4,then the third thing
4,so the idea would
4,fact that if they
4,thats not the same
4,and then try to
4,they are saying we
4,to focus on those
4,repeal of glasssteagall and
4,cut interest rates to
4,were going to see
4,going to be to
4,front of the class
4,but most of them
4,and trying to figure
4,in the mood for
4,but also in the
4,he comes up with
4,you are taking a
4,as the kind of
4,in front of us
4,and then when you
4,to do more of
4,be a bad thing
4,in the age of
4,i wanted to do
4,that the government can
4,the opening of the
4,plays a role in
4,to be very effective
4,think its an incredibly
4,do have to be
4,you double the money
4,little bit of it
4,and as far as
4,because they dont like
4,talk about how we
4,lot of people want
4,to do that thats
4,effect of that is
4,but lets say i
4,could do a better
4,to see it as
4,going to make this
4,of the questions i
4,work that he did
4,i dont know maybe
4,talk about the price
4,by the way not
4,should be done in
4,at new york university
4,the united states this
4,of it in a
4,between the two and
4,say it a different
4,pay attention to me
4,promises that have been
4,a member of congress
4,are all the same
4,for international student assessment
4,very hard to make
4,that even if they
4,are aware of the
4,why dont we take
4,the rationale for it
4,as best you can
4,said we have to
4,because it is such
4,to live in those
4,the combination of those
4,lot of this stuff
4,adam smith was a
4,the same if you
4,he got in trouble
4,to keep them in
4,not been able to
4,of people who had
4,and found that the
4,so lets look at
4,is it a sin
4,about that but you
4,say why dont you
4,if it was just
4,to have a government
4,doesnt matter what you
4,on the surface it
4,and the person who
4,that its better to
4,if you want that
4,the fundamental problem of
4,think the united states
4,and so he says
4,of the mont pelerin
4,person in the world
4,by the way was
4,just going to take
4,that the market was
4,what role do you
4,makes more sense to
4,a long story short
4,be able to repay
4,and so forth i
4,just dont know how
4,the people who own
4,there are no solutions
4,obviously there are some
4,and that of course
4,for that and i
4,a straight answer to
4,might be interested in
4,and instead of just
4,of the country so
4,try to work with
4,now it turns out
4,to say what the
4,im going to sell
4,there is some evidence
4,the fed can do
4,have been one of
4,i dont like to
4,way i think its
4,yes and i think
4,and try to find
4,first of all lets
4,so tell us what
4,to come to that
4,of course we do
4,then there is this
4,thats why i say
4,of the coase theorem
4,late 1980s early 1990s
4,that people would say
4,i think the only
4,back to where we
4,longer period of time
4,because as long as
4,to see how the
4,on it and i
4,me tell you the
4,what you think about
4,good and so i
4,in iraq and afghanistan
4,to say one thing
4,going to be going
4,it has in the
4,one thing i learned
4,the current level of
4,guest well i have
4,the nice thing about
4,i think he did
4,about it and its
4,just want to be
4,government in terms of
4,who dont want to
4,left a lot of
4,well im not so
4,give it to me
4,as an example of
4,but lets say it
4,put all your eggs
4,of the economy that
4,so lets get into
4,much money as they
4,how people feel about
4,is really going on
4,russ absolutely guest and
4,he didnt like the
4,that they should have
4,think about how much
4,as you say theres
4,when they have a
4,to tell me that
4,to be there and
4,was onto something there
4,there wouldnt be any
4,if you really believe
4,and i hope that
4,the majority of people
4,quality of life and
4,all i want to
4,result of that is
4,and you could have
4,best interests at heart
4,a few minutes but
4,do you do about
4,to the great recession
4,i live in the
4,one of the keys
4,because at the end
4,to do about that
4,between population density and
4,went out of business
4,you could argue it
4,so if you can
4,see how well they
4,the definition of disability
4,but in many ways
4,and he told me
4,united states and what
4,you do a little
4,that was a big
4,just to look at
4,people were going to
4,with each other but
4,the united states compared
4,that are not so
4,so it might be
4,eye for an eye
4,im not saying this
4,to blame it on
4,race to the bottom
4,the part that i
4,their kids to be
4,up in the united
4,the central bank in
4,what should be the
4,thing to do to
4,one reason why the
4,for those who want
4,10 years ago and
4,you and i who
4,of what the government
4,are doing better than
4,more than they did
4,how it could be
4,this is the other
4,you dont look at
4,the quality of their
4,see the evidence for
4,you can sort of
4,and what i did
4,it was due to
4,like to come back
4,them to do what
4,think its very difficult
4,and i suspect the
4,a bunch of new
4,is that it makes
4,may be that they
4,the purpose of the
4,have to be an
4,that because there are
4,than the sum of
4,the potential to do
4,he wrote a very
4,for 20 years and
4,say we dont want
4,issue that comes up
4,dont know who the
4,that point of view
4,to continue to be
4,of the government and
4,to increase the number
4,are willing to sacrifice
4,that no matter how
4,look at the price
4,this is true for
4,needs to be a
4,but then you have
4,and now you are
4,do it as a
4,think its a hard
4,the second point is
4,to all of the
4,i understand it correctly
4,throw the life ring
4,dont know very much
4,say that if you
4,in fact its the
4,kinds of things you
4,a big believer in
4,to think of them
4,and tell us about
4,to make it worth
4,a very short period
4,of that stuff is
4,lot of the things
4,do we know how
4,is not necessarily the
4,the game of bank
4,and this is true
4,that a fair summary
4,got to have a
4,its not like the
4,do it but i
4,you dont just get
4,there are rules about
4,youd be hardpressed to
4,private sector is not
4,women who drink in
4,there are others who
4,on to a different
4,in that direction and
4,thats exactly right russ
4,that the next generation
4,what they have to
4,a lot of intellectual
4,in the longer term
4,what does it do
4,if you are taking
4,it harder for people
4,think about what are
4,chairman of the council
4,it but a lot
4,going back and forth
4,at the data you
4,financial system and the
4,was the sort of
4,to cover their costs
4,thats right and the
4,do you get from
4,nominal price of gold
4,do and what they
4,things we could do
4,total spending in the
4,we dont like it
4,the parts of the
4,the chamber of commerce
4,little hard to believe
4,of the impartial spectator
4,say that we are
4,which at the time
4,been a series of
4,because of the lack
4,that there is very
4,have access to the
4,can imagine a world
4,this is the same
4,those are things like
4,and they kind of
4,of times in the
4,thought the world was
4,do that kind of
4,but its not quite
4,that you are an
4,and so the question
4,fascinating to me is
4,that but its not
4,easier for us to
4,of work in the
4,on their own so
4,it looks as if
4,people who own the
4,you know anything about
4,well what kind of
4,we need more money
4,i dont think im
4,of how it is
4,we can do things
4,so again i think
4,not at all the
4,to get a phd
4,does a lot of
4,the u of virginia
4,guest its a very
4,dont think you talk
4,more money than they
4,and you have some
4,when you dont know
4,a lot more complicated
4,government is trying to
4,we are not getting
4,from country to country
4,me an email at
4,and so i was
4,point of view its
4,a lot of ideas
4,whats going to be
4,to be a place
4,people who work for
4,be very careful about
4,of what went wrong
4,a way that would
4,a matter of getting
4,would have taken a
4,you look back at
4,of that guest well
4,it so if you
4,it is to be
4,of the person who
4,could go in and
4,going to reduce the
4,if you get rid
4,for it and the
4,you are the one
4,the time was the
4,the natural rate of
4,know what would have
4,60 votes in the
4,to have fewer children
4,there may have been
4,to work as a
4,you think those are
4,or out of the
4,theres been a huge
4,for the new yorker
4,he argued that the
4,a recent episode of
4,and so what the
4,the proof of the
4,in line with what
4,get out of a
4,jp morgan chase the
4,and they look at
4,not the fact that
4,a way that it
4,money you have to
4,back in those days
4,to get better and
4,when you walk into
4,money but of course
4,would say we have
4,have to be that
4,the separation of powers
4,to try to help
4,dont pay a lot
4,or you can have
4,a lot of which
4,that it was going
4,where did that come
4,as well as other
4,about what happened to
4,if you do something
4,though they are not
4,we are doing this
4,they dont understand the
4,we may as well
4,its hard for me
4,and freddie mac and
4,we are making the
4,in the book as
4,im thinking of is
4,that its sort of
4,because if you look
4,go on i want
4,you have a chance
4,on to some of
4,that the chinese government
4,issue in terms of
4,if they dont do
4,i mean you know
4,the extent that they
4,the party of the
4,on the best of
4,we wouldnt be here
4,turn out that way
4,ask you one more
4,is the role that
4,say that one of
4,as well i think
4,thing thats going to
4,when push comes to
4,well a lot of
4,look at it this
4,we are doing is
4,and that gives you
4,it is a public
4,most people would argue
4,been a change in
4,was trying to think
4,the other side that
4,of the system that
4,what the market is
4,or two or three
4,or at least in
4,based on what they
4,is the one thing
4,you a couple of
4,in the book one
4,in fact its just
4,be good for us
4,guest right so theres
4,live in san francisco
4,tell you what the
4,its hard to put
4,to allocate scarce resources
4,i dont know is
4,the people who say
4,but a couple of
4,but of course thats
4,would do in the
4,take an example of
4,of those kinds of
4,that you were talking
4,very influenced by the
4,a chapter in the
4,could lead to a
4,to change i think
4,to talk about those
4,one of those is
4,for their own purposes
4,our health care system
4,a lot of poor
4,would add is that
4,the last 80 years
4,people who would be
4,is good for you
4,say there are two
4,education which of course
4,friedman and anna schwartz
4,up and down and
4,there is an increase
4,a safety net for
4,my own view is
4,guest right and thats
4,i agree with your
4,fine for me to
4,the bootlegger and baptist
4,dont really know i
4,the way we were
4,think it will have
4,i have a little
4,are really interested in
4,hundreds of years ago
4,is really good at
4,the government to take
4,incentive to get it
4,and its not as
4,way of talking about
4,there was so much
4,if you listen to
4,out that they are
4,problem is in the
4,so the question i
4,when they want to
4,but its certainly true
4,they are subject to
4,get away from that
4,front of me but
4,is that the whole
4,you are saying there
4,evidence in favor of
4,so what went wrong
4,long time there was
4,and they end up
4,a high school diploma
4,so that when you
4,and other forms of
4,we have and the
4,what the effect of
4,this is what he
4,to understand what it
4,no question about it
4,think its an interesting
4,what are the key
4,we spend our time
4,the financial sector the
4,you can just go
4,these things have been
4,a case by case
4,of an impact on
4,in what you are
4,examples from the book
4,that the rise in
4,about half of them
4,national science foundation nsf
4,where there are no
4,want to be wiped
4,we are coming to
4,thing or a bad
4,seems to be happening
4,this happens all the
4,are being taken up
4,that is what the
4,its a lot more
4,i think the very
4,as you can imagine
4,the world there are
4,the eye of the
4,there was no such
4,then there would be
4,it is hard for
4,do all these things
4,best interest of the
4,that are very different
4,point you have to
4,that as well so
4,into the 21st century
4,you can be a
4,that weve had a
4,in kind of a
4,that may have been
4,in the growth rate
4,we are good at
4,i was thinking more
4,a lot of infrastructure
4,much of what we
4,i think its fascinating
4,have to listen to
4,are just on the
4,point you made which
4,of the constitution of
4,of i dont know
4,what it looks like
4,to what you said
4,is the most popular
4,you look at some
4,there but i think
4,as a whole i
4,what the government is
4,theres no evidence that
4,point a lot of
4,the midst of a
4,to get a permit
4,at the end i
4,to be in favor
4,for people to buy
4,in different ways but
4,had to pay the
4,could do a lot
4,what they can do
4,the other thing and
4,back to friedman and
4,that they could do
4,the probability of the
4,like to see that
4,to think of this
4,and i went back
4,but the way i
4,even though they have
4,to look at how
4,challenge to the keynesian
4,is its not the
4,is really important and
4,to think about things
4,to graduate from college
4,the people in charge
4,of the 1970s and
4,well the problem is
4,they dont have that
4,to do something new
4,maybe a lot more
4,its a sort of
4,have a way of
4,a set of principles
4,we are not the
4,not sure of the
4,and i think whats
4,important to emphasize that
4,that a couple of
4,thoughts on that i
4,to the side but
4,got out of hand
4,which allows me to
4,lets talk about how
4,particular circumstances of time
4,the rest of our
4,i think about how
4,much time do you
4,that the internet is
4,for some of us
4,when you get the
4,with you on this
4,there are things you
4,look at that i
4,will happen in the
4,the flip side is
4,or a bad thing
4,well i think we
4,for a much more
4,they didnt have time
4,course we dont know
4,want to make that
4,because it means that
4,sell it at the
4,whats been going on
4,risk of a heart
4,of the future of
4,you can point to
4,you see is a
4,you because you are
4,monetary fund imf and
4,you have to see
4,back in the 1950s
4,trying to get some
4,is a system that
4,it and there is
4,what am i missing
4,he meant by that
4,people in poor countries
4,of the things weve
4,tried to make a
4,united states as a
4,are better able to
4,what i call a
4,is what you said
4,want to comment on
4,that thats the way
4,market as a whole
4,in the bottom half
4,when i read it
4,so lets take a
4,and again and again
4,dont think it will
4,the internet is not
4,suppose there is a
4,what i was going
4,have a beer with
4,income tax credit or
4,the 19th century it
4,and the quality of
4,which is supposed to
4,and i understand the
4,a lot better if
4,of people out of
4,out of thin air
4,what are the incentives
4,what do you say
4,were worse than we
4,russ well the other
4,a lot of demand
4,a little skeptical about
4,you would like to
4,they are doing in
4,who is the new
4,where i think its
4,of things you can
4,i think that really
4,and what we see
4,at the time what
4,who is interested in
4,the solution is to
4,no not at all
4,and you end up
4,is quite a bit
4,and the other group
4,take the united states
4,buy a lot of
4,but also i think
4,assume that if you
4,in the flood plain
4,so there is something
4,we have a set
4,the price system is
4,i think the basic
4,of the studies of
4,it just seems to
4,is so hard to
4,right im going to
4,that guest well its
4,and if you ask
4,of a bank and
4,by the central bank
4,is that in many
4,with fannie and freddie
4,send their kids to
4,didnt know anything about
4,agree with you there
4,so they could have
4,twice as cheap every
4,we have to try
4,not as bad as
4,with most of the
4,journal of law and
4,dollars worth of stuff
4,if you use the
4,they are happy to
4,that there is going
4,come to a group
4,where it should be
4,and you give it
4,so how do we
4,but it seems like
4,and if i can
4,millennium development goals and
4,that it needs to
4,we got to the
4,where there is not
4,pay it in the
4,a very good understanding
4,ruin in a nation
4,of it that are
4,hard to measure in
4,and of course those
4,i think in general
4,to see whats going
4,have a taste for
4,be that one of
4,is this if you
4,state of the art
4,and apply it to
4,in one of his
4,the way things are
4,and so forth he
4,is going to tell
4,on the private sector
4,going to walk away
4,we had a different
4,that is created by
4,a statement about the
4,because they are just
4,going to have one
4,at the time so
4,think about the future
4,there was a study
4,so why do we
4,in the economy if
4,in the economy it
4,in the hopes that
4,of the kinds of
4,it was done in
4,people have access to
4,do we go from
4,dont think thats going
4,who doesnt want to
4,our impact on the
4,going on in this
4,had these kinds of
4,if it wants to
4,have a better life
4,very hard for us
4,me ask a different
4,its all about the
4,oh were going to
4,not something that is
4,he grew up in
4,so that to me
4,isnt it possible that
4,it have to be
4,to the american economic
4,when you make a
4,the fable of the
4,ways in which we
4,of money if you
4,a minute if you
4,things that we are
4,my impression is that
4,heart goes out to
4,there are lots and
4,come up with ways
4,we already know that
4,thats happened in the
4,the absence of a
4,i know youve written
4,it first of all
4,some of those ideas
4,when things are going
4,in the last part
4,people dont know what
4,is to say you
4,come to be called
4,you think the fed
4,you might say that
4,has to be something
4,russ they dont have
4,a different way than
4,here i want to
4,and the second question
4,again if you go
4,to tell you that
4,so you need a
4,of the problem the
4,and to smash it
4,it allows you to
4,over the next year
4,comptroller of the currency
4,of fannie mae and
4,isnt so much that
4,rest of it and
4,have an obligation to
4,the federal government could
4,was the size of
4,as the great depression
4,a thing called a
4,the time guest yeah
4,but i thought it
4,has to have some
4,you have to rely
4,out to be one
4,in the philosophy of
4,i didnt have any
4,which i would say
4,time we have a
4,you were likely to
4,these kinds of arguments
4,most of the problems
4,you i think the
4,goes the other way
4,the threat of violence
4,tend to have a
4,that kind of money
4,they are not paying
4,how you are going
4,be happening in the
4,to your question is
4,dont want to hold
4,other side of this
4,anything about that guest
4,into the market and
4,more or less what
4,the world health organization
4,do that i want
4,fannie and freddie but
4,system would look like
4,that some people will
4,maybe a couple of
4,quality of life is
4,be that if you
4,on business cycle theory
4,that for a second
4,in poor countries that
4,have to pay more
4,solve all our problems
4,that as well and
4,as they are being
4,the ones that were
4,2012 russ your book
4,can get access to
4,to engage in a
4,its a great point
4,are bad for the
4,can talk about the
4,do you know anything
4,people who are doing
4,that we dont want
4,to stay in power
4,has to be able
4,and it was only
4,have to convince people
4,that a good summary
4,be a very different
4,the course of that
4,would i want to
4,an idea of how
4,make sure you have
4,and then they get
4,out there and we
4,talked about earlier which
4,in a bunch of
4,what do i do
4,i agree with the
4,more about your health
4,for example that the
4,you worried about that
4,talk about those two
4,the path of least
4,the reason is the
4,to be with you
4,you dont have time
4,was a very different
4,this is not going
4,is we need to
4,a reaction to the
4,where you dont need
4,were talking about in
4,filling them back in
4,that on the one
4,and were not going
4,i understand the argument
4,russ one last question
4,in the last week
4,a combination of the
4,just need to get
4,and over and over
4,go out to the
4,able to get the
4,as a result and
4,whole lot of time
4,with it its a
4,and then finally the
4,well in the book
4,the characteristics of the
4,who go to college
4,is an immense amount
4,to me a very
4,it be better for
4,and how much money
4,one thing after another
4,wealth of nations and
4,came out and said
4,but i think even
4,rather than try to
4,to get a deal
4,actually going to be
4,the same in the
4,is the federal reserve
4,child mortality in ethiopia
4,dont want to work
4,me to think that
4,about the price of
4,to the gold standard
4,lot more than they
4,and then what happens
4,milton friedman and george
4,period of time the
4,ought to think about
4,it very well and
4,the problems with the
4,really hard to find
4,ways to make your
4,the rest of their
4,lot of things are
4,im inclined to think
4,end up in a
4,i think this actually
4,of the ideas that
4,imf and world bank
4,it should be that
4,got to make the
4,it gets a lot
4,respond to it and
4,do is to think
4,with you when you
4,say weve got to
4,about the future i
4,second world war and
4,so the problem is
4,the true nature of
4,and he said to
4,starting in the 1970s
4,get to some of
4,a part of that
4,would be great i
4,that the internet has
4,and i had to
4,you start talking about
4,it will be too
4,the question is when
4,are running out of
4,back to full employment
4,we are more likely
4,well lets start with
4,people out of the
4,people and they are
4,of living for the
4,the flavor of that
4,is a big difference
4,its still the case
4,people look at it
4,and youve got a
4,think you said the
4,we need to look
4,to agree with you
4,do that youve got
4,money on the table
4,it would be too
4,pay a little more
4,the idea that somehow
4,will turn out to
4,of capital in the
4,let me take a
4,and they say well
4,rather than on the
4,the time that you
4,way im going to
4,a fancy way of
4,and you go to
4,to give it a
4,interest rates fall to
4,the person with the
4,think is wrong with
4,for reasons other than
4,the second question is
4,the way the market
4,are capable of doing
4,and he says no
4,didnt know what to
4,to the detriment of
4,both in the united
4,to make the system
4,on the one side
4,about that but i
4,but the problem with
4,to show up and
4,playing by the rules
4,high rate of interest
4,huge increase in the
4,part of the answer
4,one example of the
4,short term interest rates
4,you explain that guest
4,of the economic way
4,are doing things that
4,would be the implications
4,its more likely to
4,you just talked about
4,in the constitution that
4,but that was a
4,to do as a
4,this on the program
4,is not that they
4,to have one of
4,is a very dangerous
4,at one point that
4,to say that what
4,to have in the
4,to answer the question
4,russ yeah they are
4,of it because i
4,not so bad if
4,that i mentioned earlier
4,but i like to
4,you point out i
4,oh by the way
4,what you said that
4,and it doesnt matter
4,to pay me back
4,put you in charge
4,give it to the
4,for the last 25
4,has been an enormous
4,they can design and
4,well thats true guest
4,with only a few
4,is that some people
4,most important part of
4,the organization of the
4,of the savings and
4,look at the market
4,spend as much time
4,talking about when you
4,and see what happens
4,to act that way
4,about the use of
4,out there who have
4,so that part of
4,that financial markets are
4,and that was sort
4,good for the world
4,for me it was
4,here one is that
4,the system and the
4,they just said well
4,for some types of
4,ahead guest so the
4,so lets say you
4,is its hard to
4,what is the cause
4,i look at it
4,in the future if
4,around the world we
4,today is going to
4,rate in the united
4,i care about the
4,up and down every
4,theme of your book
4,how to make money
4,there i think in
4,other hand you have
4,work at the time
4,in the next 20
4,are saying that because
4,need to do it
4,that the new drug
4,amount of money in
4,that we really need
4,russ talk about that
4,very different from what
4,there is actually a
4,the big increase in
4,do is have a
4,the response to that
4,put a price on
4,but if we look
4,in real terms for
4,he was a student
4,going to blow up
4,smartest person in the
4,not the way to
4,for us in the
4,time there is a
4,to take over the
4,you disagree with that
4,more than we did
4,which was one of
4,a distinction between the
4,way or another and
4,read the road to
4,so you get this
4,up by a factor
4,you know how much
4,so how did that
4,that talk about what
4,living beyond our means
4,of my own money
4,then at the end
4,im not a fan
4,and find out what
4,a role in that
4,on the us economy
4,are interested in and
4,if you read it
4,higher marginal tax rates
4,able to measure the
4,you can put it
4,because there is an
4,the growth in incarceration
4,like to have more
4,whats the problem with
4,which seems to be
4,that people who were
4,have to do the
4,want to pick on
4,who know how to
4,it was written in
4,going to be influenced
4,you would expect that
4,men and women are
4,thats one reason why
4,well there was a
4,to do their job
4,the time they were
4,to be viewed as
4,you have a feel
4,putting that to the
4,they want to buy
4,for a different reason
4,through the public sector
4,be included in the
4,and then they go
4,relative to the others
4,it i find it
4,current account deficits and
4,of this and then
4,good thing or a
4,ive been writing about
4,do it russ and
4,may be very different
4,say that if the
4,sides of the issue
4,all those things i
4,but there is some
4,is in some ways
4,somebody would have picked
4,at a time and
4,there are millions of
4,seems to be in
4,more than that so
4,is bad for you
4,would be the case
4,in order to buy
4,would say its a
4,that too many people
4,money and thats what
4,look back and say
4,coming up with a
4,it or not whether
4,if you agree with
4,you do the same
4,that what we have
4,to you and you
4,right now and we
4,to bid up the
4,make their own choices
4,to go out there
4,enough to cover the
4,think about anything else
4,has never been tried
4,of the reasons for
4,piece of the puzzle
4,its just a huge
4,just for the record
4,says were going to
4,when we buy a
4,to pay the price
4,reason for that was
4,what he said is
4,the things we do
4,almost all of them
4,you want to work
4,the leaders of the
4,they will be better
4,so you had to
4,im not saying they
4,a good thing there
4,you say you can
4,i would have liked
4,they are not good
4,to create a lot
4,over the last 35
4,lot of people claim
4,would have liked to
4,of course thats the
4,figuring out what the
4,is the world of
4,the process by which
4,a good idea so
4,of more and more
4,it and it would
4,the people who run
4,middle of the 19th
4,it that way but
4,but i did it
4,to do for them
4,doesnt mean that i
4,the implication is that
4,think about them and
4,as well but the
4,are citizens of the
4,makes it possible for
4,going to be looking
4,and many of these
4,and i think also
4,a year as a
4,let me just make
4,there a way to
4,find it remarkable that
4,book i talk about
4,is paying interest on
4,go on a casebycase
4,nothing to worry about
4,can go back to
4,not going to win
4,not obvious that there
4,for 20 shillings a
4,of those who won
4,hes going to have
4,it is something that
4,there is a puzzle
4,the most important things
4,that we should have
4,i think its about
4,to be loved and
4,expansion of the state
4,going to pay it
4,depends a lot on
4,is not all that
4,be able to think
4,that has gone to
4,is there are so
4,of the rational voter
4,up with a better
4,and so the problem
4,bring it to the
4,could be true of
4,try to keep the
4,on it and so
4,know more about the
4,that is what i
4,the median person is
4,tend to be in
4,is made up of
4,is that that is
4,i see that as
4,do we know what
4,when you measure the
4,first couple of years
4,up quite a bit
4,get to the end
4,or in the case
4,dont have the exact
4,is probably going to
4,very high level of
4,with a kind of
4,was a lot less
4,part of what you
4,for a while russ
4,the late 1980s early
4,seems like a pretty
4,too good to be
4,not as if the
4,can it be that
4,one part of it
4,people in it and
4,but you and i
4,the rest of europe
4,in the past decade
4,good to be true
4,will put a link
4,the nobel prize and
4,thing here is that
4,example of how the
4,im not one of
4,they will have to
4,keep in mind when
4,if the central bank
4,its not much of
4,how it can be
4,but is it really
4,that you can buy
4,some people want to
4,so lets get to
4,in terms of jobs
4,it doesnt pay to
4,of new york city
4,are making a lot
4,need some kind of
4,been very critical of
4,in economics in the
4,going to have this
4,to spend more time
4,is what has happened
4,going to work guest
4,it and so he
4,those are the kind
4,is no way that
4,that wasnt going to
4,the problem if you
4,its kind of an
4,a better standard of
4,was a very very
4,left on the table
4,whats going on but
4,look at it i
4,say that in the
4,it part of the
4,a life of its
4,and then i say
4,or what have you
4,get their house in
4,a guy who is
4,to say i have
4,you are not sure
4,who is about to
4,can be a little
4,for lack of a
4,thats not quite true
4,last thing i want
4,increases in government spending
4,banks charge each other
4,is there a third
4,me a long time
4,reasons for that one
4,for them to go
4,that we wont be
4,we should be able
4,you put them in
4,because its not going
4,and compare it to
4,can think of a
4,patterns of specialization and
4,guest yeah and thats
4,think is the right
4,tell a story that
4,at least the way
4,and that is how
4,take a trip to
4,like one of the
4,at the very beginning
4,have to ask the
4,and so forth russ
4,people and you are
4,they do it in
4,yeah go ahead guest
4,to do that if
4,to get into some
4,talk about that talk
4,prefer to live in
4,short periods of time
4,what did they do
4,that it was more
4,not know how to
4,and the government is
4,a lot of inflation
4,now there is a
4,russ sort of guest
4,of the fed that
4,to sell something for
4,to where they were
4,about the current crisis
4,i have a problem
4,going to keep going
4,people who worry about
4,be able to bring
4,and fill them back
4,a thousand flowers bloom
4,say wait a minute
4,that the government was
4,and you see what
4,it is you are
4,by the standards of
4,dont have the information
4,i suspect that the
4,the 1970s and the
4,it makes the pie
4,the role of technology
4,care so much about
4,the same sorts of
4,of the early 1930s
4,russ i hear you
4,now part of the
4,been talking about so
4,bailout of bear stearns
4,they would not have
4,because you would have
4,if you could do
4,are focused on the
4,would still be a
4,go out in the
4,is you dont want
4,going to need to
4,for kids who are
4,one of his books
4,have lots of people
4,of course we know
4,money because they are
4,so thats not an
4,a limit to how
4,and i was thinking
4,to lead to a
4,up with ways to
4,know and what we
4,in the traded sector
4,so much so that
4,that might be in
4,as much fun as
4,we know that the
4,theres a temptation to
4,in the late 1940s
4,now if you look
4,so what we need
4,is to get a
4,which is we are
4,live in the washington
4,know we have a
4,is still going to
4,you can do the
4,on the economy and
4,would have happened had
4,in a sense they
4,about what it is
4,will go on to
4,go back to those
4,in there is that
4,we have any idea
4,it was very difficult
4,so we could have
4,a bank and i
4,in the economy as
4,but if you said
4,that you get the
4,the world was coming
4,the reach of the
4,dont think its that
4,havent looked at the
4,on the value of
4,which is you are
4,i think youll find
4,a big debate in
4,russ and you are
4,for a minute when
4,i first saw it
4,bureau of economic research
4,but in the past
4,the jobs that are
4,that you look at
4,going to sort of
4,has to have a
4,the point is i
4,want to sell the
4,so that it has
4,you expect them to
4,been able to do
4,so its a big
4,one of the last
4,we are running a
4,of people with different
4,the united states after
4,has been a guest
4,do i just want
4,that gets to the
4,was aware of the
4,is not so good
4,a decade or so
4,and then wed have
4,the low end of
4,moving in that direction
4,there are two types
4,in each of these
4,sent a signal to
4,not a whole lot
4,about the difference between
4,the last 10 or
4,that would be great
4,the science of the
4,is the market price
4,set of rules and
4,how little we know
4,so they kind of
4,on a per capita
4,the more people you
4,what the federal reserve
4,i said you know
4,of the assets that
4,it isnt going to
4,but there are still
4,a guy who was
4,about a quarter of
4,want to say this
4,what it is thats
4,we might have a
4,do that and thats
4,the irony of that
4,world at the time
4,there are of course
4,the credit rating agencies
4,are talking about but
4,is the same problem
4,out most of the
4,not have a good
4,the organization for economic
4,if you dont mind
4,you dont take the
4,i can get a
4,that argument but i
4,has not been a
4,at least in a
4,problem in terms of
4,thats when you have
4,to sort of get
4,made a mistake in
4,at the bottom but
4,go back to adam
4,is an interesting question
4,a lot of industries
4,of course this is
4,the united states particularly
4,youve got a lot
4,the case of economics
4,people who are working
4,i like that and
4,they have a good
4,the economy and it
4,about that and the
4,is it important that
4,moving in and out
4,russ now you mentioned
4,its not the way
4,much attention to the
4,that the growth rate
4,which is basically a
4,want to do with
4,we had no choice
4,and what are they
4,just went out and
4,over the life of
4,of people who make
4,and they need to
4,its meant to be
4,and you are getting
4,say how can you
4,the ny times and
4,a social security system
4,makes it hard to
4,things of that sort
4,and its a big
4,way you have to
4,how much you can
4,that im trying to
4,just a bunch of
4,to get me to
4,the other and i
4,i think about my
4,what people want to
4,lets talk about a
4,a big surge in
4,heads i win tails
4,need to have some
4,do that but i
4,he was aware of
4,but after a while
4,of us i think
4,with people who have
4,that what happens is
4,this program which is
4,of a little bit
4,as the number of
4,russ well lets move
4,are kind of a
4,thing as a free
4,its always going to
4,the level of a
4,of countries that have
4,the idea of this
4,vote with their feet
4,it didnt work out
4,out of the data
4,people dont have to
4,of the sort you
4,for all of us
4,a lot of anxiety
4,just scratched the surface
4,that they can see
4,relative to the 50th
4,the manager of the
4,are out of work
4,the world on the
4,are a few things
4,and i think these
4,and to do that
4,there was also a
4,what the fed has
4,with a way to
4,that appear to be
4,anything like that so
4,but i think he
4,the financial sector you
4,part of the theory
4,enter into a contract
4,say that there are
4,hayeks the road to
4,people at the time
4,it doesnt have the
4,let you react to
4,in recent years but
4,as you say the
4,that you can find
4,that you have the
4,about a couple of
4,at the time now
4,get some of the
4,will be most comfortable
4,like that its just
4,in a healthy economy
4,who lent the money
4,that i think one
4,with it and you
4,the federal government has
4,they would have gotten
4,a lot of you
4,think we can teach
4,well get to the
4,they do not have
4,you start to wonder
4,what that means but
4,one of the very
4,the interesting things about
4,what will happen in
4,have to decide what
4,like it or not
4,policy in terms of
4,the political will to
4,of the fed as
4,guest right so i
4,i think you also
4,talked about it before
4,it wouldnt be a
4,it was a really
4,when your immune system
4,enormous amounts of money
4,be the right way
4,you could just say
4,i mean it was
4,look to the past
4,follow me on twitter
4,between the government and
4,people are interested in
4,when you put it
4,partly because of the
4,middle of the store
4,talking about the fact
4,they were supposed to
4,you want to react
4,they see it as
4,you could make the
4,of the distribution of
4,but it is certainly
4,fact that when you
4,they did in the
4,case by case basis
4,to say if you
4,want to see the
4,off the urge to
4,the 1960s or 1970s
4,as a member of
4,make an enormous amount
4,good for your heart
4,the income of a
4,it is better than
4,about 4 or 5
4,in that case but
4,of the amount of
4,then what happens is
4,it can be very
4,of people think they
4,out into the economy
4,as to whether the
4,a snapshot in time
4,times the size of
4,would say well thats
4,go out into the
4,which is the idea
4,and i have this
4,tell us anything about
4,advantage of the fact
4,that happens all the
4,by a certain amount
4,i would say to
4,wanted to be a
4,to give money to
4,point of view russ
4,should point out that
4,and various kinds of
4,we would call a
4,think about that is
4,to think in terms
4,things you are talking
4,with it i think
4,the point is the
4,think is really important
4,causes of the crisis
4,first thing i would
4,the place where the
4,last 50 years is
4,the point at which
4,what needs to be
4,to what we are
4,point is that there
4,the source of our
4,is that there arent
4,to get there and
4,be a way to
4,and make sure that
4,which i think i
4,russ and what did
4,in the shoes of
4,long as you dont
4,that would mean that
4,else in the world
4,first thing is that
4,forth and i think
4,and what i say
4,why did it take
4,for the economy or
4,spent a great deal
4,if you buy a
4,in the bottom billion
4,at one point you
4,couldnt you argue that
4,what we really need
4,they are likely to
4,there is a part
4,on the rest of
4,so when you talk
4,i tell my students
4,different set of rules
4,guest well it has
4,making lots of money
4,things so i think
4,we both agree that
4,the things you see
4,the world has changed
4,what we just talked
4,turn it over to
4,going on in these
4,or is it a
4,of our present difficulty
4,is better than the
4,have to do as
4,about this argument that
4,a lot of labor
4,there are two issues
4,dont see that as
4,those are the three
4,on top of a
4,now you can do
4,you are saying they
4,it is really a
4,what you are thinking
4,would be wrong for
4,a publically traded company
4,an exception to the
4,i think its called
4,not the way the
4,are willing to take
4,between the ages of
4,go to a good
4,thats where the money
4,the same thing we
4,a good part of
4,something that has to
4,the tail end of
4,the worst thing you
4,in most cases the
4,a bunch of these
4,to be happening in
4,at least there is
4,part of the political
4,have to move to
4,what happened to their
4,in the house and
4,very long period of
4,of the harlem childrens
4,ive been looking at
4,should be doing that
4,to put in a
4,for as long as
4,because of the fact
4,the lines of what
4,to be true but
4,you think is coming
4,we ought to go
4,thats going to have
4,way they are not
4,want to do in
4,but that was not
4,in the paper and
4,where he talked about
4,that at some point
4,weight of the evidence
4,in the next election
4,and all these other
4,we can see that
4,get all their money
4,weve made some progress
4,care about the downside
4,and what we can
4,alternative to a negotiated
4,you didnt want to
4,was made possible by
4,united states guest well
4,it its a very
4,by a bunch of
4,this is of course
4,you have a different
4,for those out there
4,the flow of funds
4,of the safety net
4,to be used for
4,he was willing to
4,but i know that
4,done in the last
4,you are not thinking
4,us to do that
4,need to be more
4,in the wrong place
4,we dont have this
4,and each of those
4,the time i think
4,the way its done
4,very critical of the
4,and you are right
4,want to sell them
4,long will it take
4,and the bank of
4,but its not because
4,the human capital model
4,russ im not so
4,accept the fact that
4,i would call it
4,and i know a
4,in the end he
4,as you mentioned earlier
4,lets close with the
4,the earlier part of
4,dont want to hear
4,talking about the book
4,dont think that was
4,thats a bit of
4,more of it and
4,but more than that
4,people talk about how
4,point which is that
4,doing in the future
4,you hear a lot
4,to be there for
4,that is that people
4,an easy way to
4,dont agree with you
4,able to find a
4,their time in the
4,hes trying to do
4,its a weird thing
4,this is what you
4,move on to something
4,only part of the
4,the supply of gold
4,a sure thing russ
4,for some kind of
4,be able to identify
4,and some people would
4,part of that but
4,the market price so
4,if they are a
4,think the main thing
4,in the 1930s i
4,yeah thats a good
4,in a significant way
4,do think it is
4,the spring of 2009
4,of the fiscal stimulus
4,is very good at
4,part of the whole
4,what we do see
4,at the top and
4,look at what happened
4,2013 russ your book
4,is that as you
4,that they are in
4,was in the 1950s
4,you are making the
4,to use the price
4,economy we dont have
4,he would have said
4,and in fact they
4,you have to follow
4,supply and demand for
4,it does is it
4,of the dangers of
4,safety net and the
4,that doesnt mean you
4,poor people around the
4,it so it was
4,know you have a
4,why did that change
4,probably a good thing
4,is required by law
4,pay them a lot
4,sympathetic to that argument
4,the effect of a
4,some other kind of
4,look at the raw
4,is a very hard
4,a case where the
4,calculation in the socialist
4,it really is true
4,so at the end
4,to look at some
4,book is that the
4,doesnt get talked about
4,a family of four
4,more than a third
4,have less incentive to
4,it quite a bit
4,to be the one
4,this was a system
4,look at the last
4,is that you want
4,you have a little
4,is the state of
4,fact that you have
4,as lender of last
4,that may make it
4,only in the united
4,costs of health care
4,doing all kinds of
4,is they are not
4,you think its a
4,just have to get
4,it but it is
4,thinking in terms of
4,there is some truth
4,it on the program
4,are talking about are
4,of your ability to
4,but what your book
4,see if they are
4,is different from the
4,guest yeah russ so
4,and our standard of
4,what is it guest
4,in the bank and
4,on the health care
4,of the economy its
4,lot of talk about
4,whatever it is and
4,talk about how you
4,of the problem we
4,of the income tax
4,i think if the
4,the way the government
4,something that has been
4,no no im not
4,in the marketplace and
4,you what kind of
4,the timing of the
4,balance sheets of the
4,to deal with all
4,the difference between these
4,a reduction in the
4,who was trying to
4,agree with a lot
4,point here is that
4,being able to see
4,have no incentive to
4,and it leads to
4,towards the end of
4,a lot of extra
4,later in his life
4,of a particular kind
4,increase in the size
4,want to hear what
4,and if they can
4,the answer would be
4,had to come up
4,to have a job
4,i used to teach
4,in which he was
4,on the board and
4,when i say that
4,there were in fact
4,of it as something
4,but all of the
4,so what you end
4,and you are just
4,to not be able
4,easy for us to
4,how long does it
4,than they were before
4,argue that there are
4,could have made a
4,was put into place
4,in the realm of
4,to some extent in
4,other aspects of the
4,than i do i
4,it would take a
4,rates fall to zero
4,want to read the
4,want to buy your
4,far as to say
4,get the money from
4,if we are looking
4,we were on the
4,have to be humble
4,they have the right
4,not going to buy
4,recessions in the united
4,to say when i
4,in my life and
4,say if you want
4,the money to buy
4,game of bank bargains
4,and how it works
4,to work and they
4,im not obliged to
4,that we cant do
4,them we are going
4,which i know you
4,we have a big
4,dont have any problem
4,the social cost of
4,to have as many
4,when you actually look
4,is not doing very
4,do even better than
4,most people are not
4,need to get out
4,one of my colleagues
4,sure there are a
4,i see it in
4,challenge is how do
4,im sympathetic to the
4,out the financial sector
4,those of us on
4,when there are a
4,i believe that the
4,the financial sector to
4,my preference would be
4,guest no no no
4,to be good at
4,of that in fact
4,a little bit faster
4,be able to measure
4,as the source of
4,there can be a
4,thats the end of
4,when he was writing
4,spends a lot of
4,doing a very good
4,the bill of rights
4,every one of them
4,thats just the way
4,i think its good
4,that as soon as
4,the age of 30
4,yeah there is a
4,i think is pretty
4,of the car and
4,to be much of
4,guest well its hard
4,didnt see it coming
4,but i think where
4,does seem to me
4,one has to be
4,let me say it
4,but if you just
4,growth in the united
4,is a pretty good
4,get it back and
4,there are parts that
4,but it is the
4,if that were the
4,that its okay to
4,takes to be a
4,they are actually doing
4,are very difficult to
4,big fan of the
4,so i thought it
4,whether thats a good
4,that are based on
4,are paid a lot
4,could go out of
4,this day and age
4,what went wrong guest
4,the general medical council
4,do they have in
4,to do is say
4,as i said in
4,well lets turn to
4,so how can we
4,of the way they
4,of the system to
4,in fact we are
4,if it was the
4,but thats what we
4,the fixed costs of
4,try to make a
4,what we dont have
4,and that has to
4,guest i think if
4,of work on this
4,just a piece of
4,at least for now
4,lot on this program
4,we had a world
4,the average college graduate
4,and what have you
4,we are not making
4,you dont know and
4,what that is the
4,on the web is
4,will have to do
4,that when the fed
4,to be i think
4,came out it was
4,you have some very
4,of the biggest problems
4,five or ten years
4,it at the market
4,keep them in the
4,or some other kind
4,some of the stories
4,there was very little
4,little more about the
4,market in the united
4,it was the first
4,didnt know what was
4,hard to know exactly
4,people dont think about
4,the last presidential election
4,he didnt have the
4,that not only do
4,that i was going
4,think most of them
4,in the last century
4,would be a mistake
4,that this project is
4,is that what the
4,do it better than
4,do it at a
4,so where is the
4,of the human enterprise
4,things that are the
4,if we are talking
4,in terms of getting
4,you have a huge
4,on your way to
4,say id like to
4,for example you might
4,back and looked at
4,chance to talk about
4,to land labor and
4,and that is not
4,because if you dont
4,but they had to
4,you are talking to
4,or something of that
4,do have a lot
4,but in many cases
4,but even if they
4,and what we dont
4,that thats not going
4,i think thats something
4,along the way i
4,the problem it was
4,as an undergraduate and
4,important is it to
4,the debate in the
4,they do that is
4,you might end up
4,want you to be
4,is because we have
4,i spent a lot
4,controlling the money supply
4,the question is are
4,he said that the
4,i think the argument
4,i think we often
4,wasnt a lot of
4,yeah i agree guest
4,the framers of the
4,what i think you
4,get a little more
4,boom and bust cycle
4,or whether they are
4,on is that the
4,at very low cost
4,got to have some
4,attention to you and
4,for it to be
4,is this is a
4,and if it doesnt
4,going to go through
4,that happened in the
4,how you came to
4,all the things we
4,being able to make
4,do you find it
4,of people who go
4,dont have data on
4,out of current taxes
4,there is an argument
4,right to say that
4,to borrow money and
4,because of what we
4,i can buy it
4,would like to do
4,are out there and
4,one is you are
4,1950s and 1960s when
4,of adam smith is
4,that one way to
4,to have much of
4,has to be paid
4,and they will be
4,one of which was
4,but its not obvious
4,of uncertainty about what
4,sense to look at
4,that are related to
4,that comes from the
4,in a way where
4,us to think about
4,a high school dropout
4,you may have to
4,is that you cant
4,it because we dont
4,the federal government through
4,time do you spend
4,its hard for people
4,never been a time
4,in the market to
4,for a little while
4,second half of the
4,heres a bunch of
4,question and i think
4,point in the book
4,what i would have
4,terms of the number
4,years ago i was
4,you compare it to
4,like that in the
4,russ i think they
4,quite a lot about
4,but i just dont
4,depression of the 1930s
4,change the incentives of
4,the price level and
4,other than the fact
4,the reason i dont
4,the time we are
4,a bit of an
4,when you do it
4,people with high levels
4,of those people are
4,were trying to get
4,what to do to
4,a sudden you have
4,people in the business
4,there are studies that
4,of the other countries
4,all the time if
4,has to be right
4,price of gold and
4,can be hard to
4,might have been the
4,to do that well
4,wanted to write a
4,the problem which is
4,you want to subsidize
4,to do that which
4,talking about the general
4,still have to pay
4,i think is just
4,is no question that
4,who dont have the
4,feel that way i
4,funded out of current
4,the economy has been
4,number of people on
4,so it doesnt really
4,and then were going
4,a little or a
4,you give it to
4,i think weve been
4,we dont know whats
4,thats why interest rates
4,so there is this
4,dream of the commons
4,much more effective than
4,are going to live
4,last thing you want
4,played by the rules
4,ask what are the
4,he also had a
4,of course you have
4,and then i have
4,a very important point
4,the goose that lays
4,he says that the
4,better off if they
4,on the face of
4,because the pie is
4,well the united states
4,for different kinds of
4,is the way its
4,the early 1990s when
4,going to say no
4,to some sort of
4,and we see this
4,seem to be able
4,are in the process
4,we dont know and
4,situation where there is
4,to me that when
4,we know what that
4,of money and i
4,would say thats a
4,lot of the same
4,think its one of
4,as if we have
4,since then there have
4,that you are actually
4,but it really is
4,the modern world is
4,of business cycles and
4,you look for example
4,thinking about this in
4,a very long period
4,there is no problem
4,on the republican side
4,you have to wait
4,being able to say
4,think they are wrong
4,we havent had any
4,could do that with
4,the rest of his
4,i have a quote
4,well get into that
4,political system and the
4,of it can be
4,a good idea guest
4,work very well and
4,that that is a
4,a world where they
4,looking at it from
4,a good idea not
4,in order to protect
4,to the fair trade
4,time to go into
4,interesting question i think
4,the white house and
4,the chief financial officer
4,that were part of
4,and its relationship to
4,need to have the
4,to be looking at
4,so what you do
4,is a small number
4,are at the bottom
4,over time and in
4,it russ well i
4,tell them what to
4,on a little bit
4,we need to create
4,of the fed in
4,and it looks like
4,i think about this
4,count the number of
4,such a big deal
4,an answer to that
4,is the same but
4,the chairman of the
4,aspect of your immune
4,a lot in terms
4,all you need to
4,that if you give
4,do a little better
4,more and more in
4,and i dont like
4,asked him why he
4,you can do things
4,but he was also
4,was in the middle
4,sort of thing i
4,relative to what we
4,there would still be
4,link up to that
4,if i try to
4,to do it at
4,you may disagree with
4,to that guest i
4,for the bulk of
4,about the distinction between
4,the economy so if
4,in fact one of
4,we are taping this
4,make sure that there
4,1 or the top
4,market is going up
4,you have a better
4,to go beyond the
4,it this is the
4,and i think were
4,is that what we
4,the idea of what
4,with that for a
4,all your eggs in
4,in a different direction
4,now lets look at
4,at a point where
4,they are starting to
4,the supreme court which
4,right but i think
4,to close with a
4,think about this in
4,you want your kid
4,russ so im going
4,the political implications of
4,of the economy has
4,do you think would
4,that its possible to
4,to think this is
4,years ago when i
4,the only way the
4,but its interesting to
4,what are the lessons
4,not in the way
4,people are a little
4,that in the 1950s
4,how many people do
4,guest yeah they are
4,ought to be more
4,everyone is going to
4,the right thing i
4,the country as a
4,way i like to
4,you started off by
4,that you didnt have
4,was going to take
4,the problem of the
4,they are working for
4,appear to be a
4,up and up and
4,and one thing i
4,feel guilty about it
4,you want to pay
4,the late 1980s and
4,a place where there
4,are the two groups
4,states off the gold
4,ought to be the
4,know you are not
4,to solve this problem
4,about why you think
4,you are working with
4,so what was the
4,hard to believe but
4,next couple of years
4,spend the rest of
4,to point out is
4,on interest rates and
4,my feeling is that
4,russ which is guest
4,situation we are in
4,the great things about
4,but the thing is
4,as a fraction of
4,sell it for more
4,in the us is
4,have no reason to
4,the more people will
4,none of that is
4,how it works and
4,its going to come
4,way in which they
4,think there are many
4,i think he would
4,there wasnt a lot
4,with regard to the
4,of people in that
4,to be a student
4,these people are going
4,it seems to meand
4,clearly a lot of
4,of this is you
4,the transactions costs of
4,roughly equal to the
4,point i dont think
4,in the new yorker
4,something close to a
4,of course thats a
4,lets start by talking
4,president of the ny
4,to be which is
4,the particular circumstances of
4,you think would be
4,because ive got a
4,journal of political economy
4,to do this that
4,out that if you
4,do you go from
4,about the problem of
4,in the crime rate
4,few and far between
4,about it at the
4,russ its an interesting
4,a temptation to say
4,that weve seen in
4,on the same day
4,we used to think
4,the gain to the
4,i dont think many
4,we can debate about
4,in ways that we
4,was the beginning of
4,i dont speak german
4,of the country that
4,which was designed to
4,each other all the
4,think its not going
4,all part of the
4,we didnt have time
4,in most of those
4,other part of this
4,think about that guest
4,of course some of
4,the big question is
4,world we have a
4,so in the book
4,but of course what
4,is in a way
4,panel on climate change
4,might not want to
4,the only way for
4,are circumstances in which
4,i said in the
4,have some sort of
4,think thats true but
4,on its own but
4,about it i dont
4,the 19th and 20th
4,going to be and
4,its a little too
4,lets start with some
4,that you could get
4,got the nobel prize
4,you thought it was
4,really whats going on
4,height of the crisis
4,i cant help but
4,thats not true guest
4,of my best friends
4,a little bit maybe
4,would you do with
4,in terms of social
4,people you have to
4,but it doesnt have
4,depends what you mean
4,what role does the
4,in thinking about the
4,you say if you
4,a little bit not
4,say that there is
4,in favor of free
4,not quite sure how
4,so they had to
4,you are right to
4,want to talk first
4,more money to spend
4,equal to the rate
4,on a gold standard
4,what we have done
4,can come back and
4,do i mean by
4,the challenge is how
4,what we have is
4,it was just the
4,in a rich country
4,what you need and
4,to be less than
4,because i think people
4,i think were going
4,thats what they are
4,but thats different from
4,if they dont want
4,the answer is in
4,is in a situation
4,going to call it
4,some of the big
4,the labor market but
4,of the time guest
4,both sides of that
4,in this world the
4,think its important that
4,then we need to
4,best alternative to a
4,on the customers side
4,think you talked about
4,that i dont want
4,go ahead and do
4,out of a recession
4,is that not only
4,ive got a lot
4,neglecting the fact that
4,a way to have
4,if you are right
4,and you see an
4,think its a matter
4,it is that it
4,that we are really
4,to do much better
4,we have a good
4,things i learned from
4,the seen and the
4,when you are younger
4,the challenge is to
4,when in fact its
4,of course many people
4,be all and end
4,think its very interesting
4,example a lot of
4,from my point of
4,are talking about now
4,dont think you are
4,as kind of a
4,if thats what you
4,dont do that you
4,going to make us
4,have the same kind
4,have to work at
4,ways to make it
4,cost of health care
4,the book out there
4,that thats what the
4,we went back to
4,at all and i
4,has to come from
4,was kind of the
4,saying we are going
4,more important point is
4,course they are not
4,to make money but
4,back up to the
4,clearly in the data
4,because they didnt want
4,look for example at
4,because its a good
4,side of the issue
4,a grocery store and
4,we might be able
4,but they are going
4,there any way to
4,the asian financial crisis
4,the idea that a
4,the idea that i
4,saying you have to
4,is that its the
4,we are looking for
4,do you feel about
4,take an example from
4,say we just need
4,a free market economist
4,they are doing when
4,are starting to get
4,be able to control
4,im interested in the
4,to say there is
4,back to where it
4,the discount rate that
4,on how do you
4,new under the sun
4,is really just a
4,i think even the
4,like there is a
4,not a very attractive
4,more skeptical about the
4,the lines of the
4,you have to pick
4,you cant say its
4,we know exactly how
4,i dont know there
4,to fill it in
4,so all of a
4,that was a joke
4,to fight the war
4,and so on is
4,we dont know a
4,we end up with
4,put him in a
4,where you can see
4,once you start thinking
4,whats going on so
4,of it and we
4,to make money in
4,you point out thats
4,the federal reserve would
4,jersey and new york
4,to do it guest
4,that theres been a
4,im a skeptic on
4,would we want to
4,is no longer a
4,you dont know where
4,move to the united
4,about the possibility of
4,the economy of the
4,why do we need
4,so it will be
4,the support of the
4,i would say there
4,to make that decision
4,also the fact that
4,that and the reason
4,the things is that
4,i hadnt thought of
4,when you are dealing
4,knew that they were
4,lot in terms of
4,there is an immense
4,standard of living you
4,is it a good
4,at this point and
4,education a lot of
4,minimum wage is a
4,think we are doing
4,and so this was
4,of the world bank
4,eat as much as
4,give you a different
4,its not that theres
4,are different from other
4,government would bail them
4,dont know what would
4,which turned out to
4,in the world russ
4,thats the most important
4,in the 1970s they
4,little bit of that
4,well it is a
4,the problems with this
4,all the time russ
4,the composition of the
4,care about how much
4,that the current system
4,of the poor are
4,the ones who want
4,and thats why you
4,thats sort of what
4,see it in the
4,of the country and
4,be willing to take
4,the amount of rain
4,are in the top
4,interest rates hit zero
4,lot of time talking
4,fiscal house in order
4,when people say the
4,russ now of course
4,the burden of proof
4,which is the following
4,is so much more
4,didnt know much about
4,more years of schooling
4,why would you ever
4,after the end of
4,im not sure the
4,i do have some
4,for me to say
4,in the us and
4,increase the risk of
4,to take a loss
4,a good idea in
4,the majority of the
4,i think what makes
4,i think adam smith
4,the united states off
4,but if you say
4,thats the way you
4,if all goes well
4,care about the environment
4,that for a lot
4,you dont really have
4,and one way to
4,walking down the street
4,that these things are
4,the banks are holding
4,is a challenge to
4,want to react to
4,years or so is
4,about it and we
4,may be better than
4,are lots of other
4,that people will be
4,and then they will
4,weve seen in the
4,but i do see
4,present difficulty is that
4,is the one we
4,what the problem is
4,the labor market to
4,in the listening audience
4,you want you can
4,some of our listeners
4,is if you just
4,of the housing bubble
4,to the house and
4,of gdp gross domestic
4,he spent a lot
4,decide whether or not
4,it would seem that
4,add up to a
4,the us government will
4,a chance to get
4,thought about it a
4,up and i think
4,at the bottom who
4,interest rate down to
4,i use the example
4,risks for the sake
4,what i see as
4,we are on the
4,it which is that
4,is the product of
4,its always good to
4,rest of the year
4,time part of the
4,not thinking about the
4,that way and the
4,ways in which the
4,and its one of
4,that we talk about
4,you could have the
4,so why is that
4,its not such a
4,as long as i
4,in the test group
4,russ so lets go
4,would be useful to
4,and you could see
4,you dont want the
4,in this country for
4,do whatever it takes
4,what we find is
4,this could have been
4,of the lack of
4,doesnt mean they are
4,to this idea that
4,and you can do
4,thats not what they
4,the next six months
4,to be in that
4,in the last 510
4,right i think its
4,no more than a
4,much in terms of
4,and then what happened
4,theres nothing romantic about
4,in this area and
4,in a way a
4,going to have less
4,to do and how
4,the book of the
4,smiths theory of moral
4,i think for some
4,to be around him
4,to talk first about
4,are going to think
4,at the end you
4,i could have done
4,appropriate role for government
4,russ and there are
4,that was the most
4,because they are afraid
4,of the story the
4,and put it into
4,its an accident that
4,that much of a
4,and we would be
4,for the last 10
4,you think it is
4,to do it all
4,a little worried about
4,the attention of the
4,went back and looked
4,to have to answer
4,in this day and
4,lot of truth to
4,same as it is
4,who go to the
4,you always have to
4,30year fixed rate mortgage
4,these things and we
4,thought we were going
4,think its a really
4,for them and they
4,of other things and
4,pretty good job of
4,the 21st century and
4,its really hard for
4,and part of that
4,and i would suggest
4,in a competitive market
4,around the world who
4,tiny part of the
4,whats going on or
4,whats going on on
4,to a good school
4,is the thing thats
4,important to think about
4,the last three decades
4,think about it it
4,see that there is
4,they are about to
4,be part of a
4,that they try to
4,that had gone on
4,thing to do in
4,sums of money to
4,be a problem but
4,time to be a
4,if you dont want
4,are and how they
4,they going to do
4,to do that what
4,it makes a difference
4,could go the other
4,the book that you
4,for some people it
4,than a third of
4,do something like that
4,of the distribution and
4,least in terms of
4,which is if we
4,in a business school
4,i think it makes
4,much of this is
4,do this in the
4,so im not really
4,to be used in
4,because youve got to
4,you are not so
4,the most famous example
4,not the only part
4,we can do that
4,first of all that
4,the reason why you
4,there is a chance
4,and say well what
4,is a lot harder
4,theres an enormous amount
4,be less than the
4,that guest its a
4,a bit of it
4,1970s and early 1980s
4,that was the first
4,in capitalism and freedom
4,monetary policy which is
4,a lot of failures
4,some have argued that
4,to make that happen
4,which is why they
4,of his life he
4,be better off what
4,to the global economy
4,we tend to forget
4,lets take an example
4,they look like the
4,we may end up
4,a small percentage of
4,back to that in
4,they have an interest
4,where you can say
4,professor of moral philosophy
4,it has to have
4,guest yeah and the
4,and so the people
4,dont have an answer
4,a little bit above
4,to have a say
4,of the public good
4,an eye on things
4,of the violence trap
4,in the senate and
4,amount of medical care
4,book i think its
4,the people who made
4,and certainly in the
4,whereas in the united
4,that the bulk of
4,i made a mistake
4,the real value of
4,it as part of
4,you are right about
4,its not just because
4,they are doing what
4,its important to understand
4,in the socialist commonwealth
4,want to be clear
4,of government and the
4,like that and i
4,of the treasury and
4,in the hundreds of
4,you know how to
4,standard of living if
4,is much harder to
4,in a certain dimension
4,a negative moral act
4,is that the reason
4,very much part of
4,value of the stock
4,now we have the
4,if you know a
4,government is capable of
4,the book i talk
4,bear stearns had been
4,in other words what
4,out one of the
4,i think this was
4,we usually think of
4,part of our economy
4,and theres a whole
4,that sounds like a
4,its sort of a
4,why did you write
4,would look like if
4,the federal reserve has
4,i want to keep
4,there is always some
4,a copy of the
4,i think will be
4,structured in advance of
4,path of least resistance
4,right now i dont
4,it does in the
4,one of the central
4,from the u of
4,give you a sense
4,the left or the
4,and how we might
4,as you say we
4,millennium villages project is
4,some of the flavor
4,company is going to
4,the diversity of the
4,so here you have
4,the piece of paper
4,to do with government
4,make a list of
4,the amount of violence
4,are now going to
4,dont know the exact
4,of the implications of
4,like to see a
4,said i want to
4,as well so i
4,say you are a
4,they have a stake
4,by the private sector
4,know that there are
4,does not make it
4,think they are a
4,at all in fact
4,idea that they are
4,of the world of
4,thought about it before
4,he wrote a book
4,with what you said
4,sure i understand the
4,would like to live
4,becoming more and more
4,at least on paper
4,is a term that
4,to find out if
4,very hard to figure
4,is that kind of
4,of the details of
4,about your health than
4,you are in trouble
4,and the more you
4,made possible by the
4,you can have the
4,guest im not saying
4,a mix of both
4,is one of them
4,one answer would be
4,but putting that to
4,you are in an
4,get away from the
4,the one that we
4,something that looks like
4,to find out whether
4,the design of the
4,there are sort of
4,easiest person to fool
4,the counterfactual what would
4,many times in the
4,have noticed that there
4,where are we going
4,that is that you
4,60 miles an hour
4,the first of the
4,took a while to
4,russ i was going
4,for them i think
4,majority of the population
4,but the point i
4,the experience of the
4,make sure we are
4,and i took it
4,lot of it was
4,you do want to
4,even though we are
4,it is that they
4,are not using the
4,end up with the
4,to give you another
4,in the original paper
4,the supreme court decision
4,is you dont know
4,but you are only
4,most of the things
4,and i am not
4,hard thing to do
4,is the question of
4,you really look at
4,about it and so
4,its more complicated than
4,it mean to say
4,might be wrong but
4,to be doing something
4,of that and then
4,think the bottom line
4,of the bush tax
4,he was a great
4,because he wanted to
4,almost all of the
4,as well and so
4,its a bad thing
4,going to make sure
4,harlem childrens zone which
4,numbers of people who
4,that people care about
4,never be the same
4,you are sitting there
4,what do you find
4,no one would ever
4,decide what kind of
4,that we get the
4,a very different kind
4,what was important about
4,weve seen is that
4,a little bit hard
4,guest well you have
4,it makes it harder
4,there and a lot
4,was trying to do
4,and one of those
4,do some of the
4,a little bit for
4,was that the federal
4,russ im with you
4,russ you dont think
4,that seem to be
4,second point is that
4,there are some that
4,the top and the
4,and you start to
4,points out is that
4,its a very hard
4,but this is not
4,to be very much
4,and it will give
4,limits of our knowledge
4,and he says in
4,cant do that and
4,you dont really need
4,sleep better at night
4,tell you why i
4,do it and they
4,how do you see
4,right i agree with
4,start by looking at
4,in one of these
4,coming back to my
4,of it is obviously
4,high school degree and
4,the cost of a
4,open market operations and
4,wanted to get that
4,it seems like its
4,can be thought of
4,and what should we
4,of that would be
4,me there are a
4,russ and they are
4,even if you could
4,we can come up
4,of us who have
4,the edge of a
4,to me which is
4,we move on to
4,russ and the other
4,seems to me one
4,get the money and
4,russ so just to
4,this is just the
4,to give up on
4,climate variability and change
4,you know this guy
4,that over the next
4,so its true that
4,a lot of truth
4,so its going to
4,this is an effect
4,so on and they
4,the effect of it
4,is going to create
4,the economics of the
4,i look back at
4,we might think about
4,seems to be something
4,would be looking at
4,the key is that
4,other part of that
4,we want you to
4,in the world which
4,a lot to the
4,some of the insights
4,going to be made
4,everywhere in the world
4,marginal tax rates that
4,on the left the
4,the idea is to
4,its all going to
4,to what they are
4,was coming to an
4,which is a sort
4,if you are out
4,i think its fair
4,you are probably not
4,i really do think
4,for most of human
4,use the example of
4,all of them and
4,winning the nobel prize
4,money and give it
4,based on the fact
4,have to buy a
4,propensity to truck barter
4,talk about this a
4,the same thing you
4,know guest i think
4,the market price but
4,not turn out to
4,long as they dont
4,a complicated set of
4,be able to function
4,the 20th century we
4,end of the summer
4,of time trying to
4,no longer have to
4,of the bottom billion
4,being in charge of
4,i am saying is
4,access to it and
4,to me is one
4,chinese yuan is undervalued
4,of technology and globalization
4,have a very small
4,are thinking about doing
4,do is we can
4,led by an invisible
4,guest right i think
4,i think whats happening
4,because i believe the
4,is what makes it
4,that is hard to
4,on that its a
4,think about the ways
4,way i dont think
4,when you say you
4,the world is going
4,russ what kind of
4,a way to say
4,because what we are
4,to work in a
4,so some of them
4,at the end russ
4,i think that he
4,level of government spending
4,at the amount of
4,think its fair to
4,before a lot of
4,where is the evidence
4,worse than what we
4,are good or bad
4,because they cant do
4,they dont see the
4,start off with the
4,a big difference so
4,absolutely i think that
4,was the first to
4,they know if they
4,kind of argument that
4,credit rating agencies and
4,is not likely to
4,to pay the money
4,by being able to
4,can teach people to
4,im going to leave
4,all those excess reserves
4,part of our present
4,i was told that
4,the fair trade label
4,he was worried about
4,a role for the
4,you are the easiest
4,live in that world
4,to take it and
4,guest thats right if
4,so heres the question
4,that they are willing
4,an argument that i
4,russ its a good
4,are hard to measure
4,what i would like
4,the person on the
4,you are telling me
4,right now you have
4,that we kind of
4,paul krugman and others
4,it was good for
4,if this were a
4,which you point out
4,the more likely you
4,even when you are
4,the 20th century the
4,the first one i
4,benefit of the doubt
4,that is much more
4,russ yeah go ahead
4,its hard to find
4,you think that is
4,one more thing about
4,did that come from
4,so you dont know
4,to take a haircut
4,guest actually i think
4,people who used to
4,about whether you can
4,to force you to
4,to try to teach
4,be worth as much
4,we had a lot
4,guest yeah he was
4,part of it and
4,are talking about right
4,think there should be
4,to do is get
4,is there such a
4,know that much about
4,you might think of
4,such a bad thing
4,to the way they
4,and he wanted to
4,if we could have
4,think we want to
4,doing a better job
4,well this is a
4,we need to figure
4,is not a big
4,this is where he
4,a picture of a
4,the point where we
4,the free flow of
4,who want to go
4,the time i was
4,all the time they
4,whats wrong with those
4,do know that the
4,have said that the
4,of the quality of
4,the probability of violence
4,i would say thats
4,captain of the ship
4,how to do things
4,i salute you for
4,policy on the part
4,about what should be
4,most out of life
4,people who are poor
4,and how do they
4,because as you said
4,fair enough guest and
4,a lot on the
4,very different kind of
4,just need to do
4,that a correct summary
4,you can see why
4,be the best way
4,who seem to be
4,are going to draw
4,buy a pair of
4,group of people that
4,not a way to
4,of people are going
4,with them and the
4,they come from the
4,but its also true
4,and they would be
4,to what you just
4,to the middle class
4,and the president has
4,and i find it
4,all have the same
4,to make up for
4,the expansion of credit
4,there i think the
4,differences between the two
4,think most of the
4,decided they were going
4,the central banking system
4,very short period of
4,to have a much
4,sector in the united
4,massive open online courses
4,bottom half of the
4,if i said to
4,thats what has to
4,of how do we
4,may not have a
4,as it is the
4,or not so in
4,to draw the line
4,one of the implications
4,of the problems in
4,we know from the
4,i dont really have
4,thats kind of the
4,that a lot more
4,is how much the
4,on that which is
4,if you put them
4,its not nearly as
4,is most of the
4,why do you need
4,are doing when they
4,1990s and early 2000s
4,you are forced to
4,they have a very
4,be able to compete
4,about the rest of
4,so its really a
4,with the people who
4,say you dont have
4,doing anything with it
4,of the modern world
4,countries around the world
4,a year which is
4,we be able to
4,you fall in love
4,to that if you
4,they may not have
4,how to do this
4,not doing as well
4,but you are talking
4,think thats absolutely right
4,as people who are
4,comes back to this
4,we think about those
4,its a very strange
4,not so sure about
4,is you look at
4,so id like to
4,interest on reserves and
4,to take on the
4,it you want to
4,when you say it
4,these kinds of policies
4,but thats part of
4,dont think that is
4,in the economy thats
4,what they do at
4,actually have to take
4,i have a number
4,a few decades ago
4,we are not all
4,well of course the
4,with a company that
4,which is if you
4,dont need to go
4,and if you cant
4,the central bank should
4,of an increase in
4,the return to education
4,over the next 5
4,has happened to the
4,on that we dont
4,about the same as
4,to get past the
4,to pay for those
4,at the moment that
4,in the business cycle
4,have to take the
4,to have a tax
4,is what we just
4,matter what you do
4,we cant do this
4,would be a pretty
4,i would argue is
4,better off without making
4,caused a lot of
4,have gone down in
4,right i think that
4,would be too much
4,people who say we
4,in the world economy
4,that doesnt have to
4,in many ways they
4,regulated by the federal
4,put it on a
4,think the way to
4,so lets move on
4,that must have been
4,whether they are good
4,are going to turn
4,of different ways to
4,and you do it
4,up with this idea
4,and they dont even
4,doesnt have the same
4,thats what he did
4,and in fact if
4,would be a great
4,are other ways to
4,situation where you have
4,russ well thats the
4,do the best job
4,not clear that the
4,know whether you are
4,at least in my
4,of the problem not
4,russ i have not
4,thats going to affect
4,we know that in
4,you are running a
4,do a power calculation
4,to make a better
4,dont know theres a
4,is to be a
4,place and i think
4,and then you just
4,and the one thing
4,the most important difference
4,your own money and
4,so in some sense
4,takes a while for
4,know thats not true
4,we would be able
4,when people say well
4,be more like the
4,that you are saying
4,a point where the
4,in the most recent
4,you point out theres
4,of what you think
4,its not really the
4,were going to try
4,dozens and dozens of
4,thats not the right
4,we think we know
4,tell you that the
4,up and then you
4,and bring them to
4,and well put up
4,how long will it
4,will never be the
4,same time there are
4,the people who lent
4,other way around so
4,dont put all your
4,be able to come
4,its kind of funny
4,the supply of labor
4,so a couple of
4,and you know that
4,and i said i
4,man in the world
4,not sure how much
4,has a huge impact
4,the side effects of
4,only care about the
4,about that if you
4,instead of having the
4,was not a good
4,youve got to give
4,rate of inflation and
4,people who know a
4,i dont think of
4,with you that its
4,have to know the
4,look at whats happened
4,to be paid for
4,right now when you
4,to take some time
4,go along with it
4,been able to take
4,amount of work that
4,much as they should
4,very different than the
4,economics is the study
4,on the dollar because
4,is an interesting case
4,and say i dont
4,at the people who
4,about it all the
4,do you pay for
4,of that which is
4,done a great job
4,im going to lose
4,surprising to me that
4,do with the fed
4,essence of economics is
4,i dont know thats
4,i wanted to be
4,be able to recognize
4,here is that if
4,of them of course
4,world a lot of
4,and if they had
4,the world is more
4,they were allowed to
4,by a relatively small
4,period of time when
4,some subset of the
4,me in terms of
4,you dont see any
4,talked about before on
4,a hundred years from
4,nearly as much as
4,try to sell it
4,united states that we
4,its the job of
4,have to pay attention
4,more than a decade
4,to say that but
4,happen to be a
4,in the last crisis
4,the thing we are
4,of the game so
4,because i have to
4,a lot of businesses
4,sharp increase in the
4,people have heard of
4,easy to talk about
4,its not very good
4,bear stearns or lehman
4,system in a way
4,to see that the
4,i dont like that
4,and then weve got
4,in the early stages
4,write about in the
4,you may be able
4,them in terms of
4,high saturated fat diet
4,still the case that
4,true or not and
4,that some people are
4,in the banking industry
4,point of view what
4,going to be my
4,standard of living the
4,second half of 2008
4,are most likely to
4,out of pocket but
4,and in fact he
4,is that once you
4,year in year out
4,that i dont see
4,about the balance sheet
4,a lot of theories
4,but why would you
4,to work and the
4,have the resources to
4,is something that the
4,have to pay higher
4,you need to look
4,to be made and
4,to the financial system
4,they had access to
4,some period of time
4,that i am going
4,the banks balance sheet
4,a current account deficit
4,what a lot of
4,i didnt mean to
4,it takes in in
4,by the fed and
4,yeah i think there
4,of the banks in
4,think the reason is
4,if the government had
4,that they may be
4,it can also be
4,in north america and
4,seems to me a
4,you could imagine a
4,that took place in
4,back to the beginning
4,also the case that
4,health education and government
4,approach and i think
4,a different way i
4,lot of pressure on
4,a little bit nervous
4,they talk about it
4,you dont even have
4,referred to as the
4,talking about which is
4,is a group of
4,for government intervention in
4,everybody in the world
4,do you think people
4,there is a real
4,know how to use
4,50 or 100 years
4,do some kind of
4,that there was something
4,puts you in a
4,you are good at
4,back to the 1920s
4,on that guest yeah
4,how easy or hard
4,because if you go
4,into the economy and
4,that would be less
4,out of graduate school
4,these different kinds of
4,like that that would
4,going to get more
4,know some of the
4,intergovernmental panel on climate
4,united states russ and
4,with the rule of
4,of a central bank
4,a lot fewer people
4,and thats hard to
4,is with respect to
4,so what are some
4,before we leave this
4,have to start from
4,follow the same people
4,all the other ones
4,pushes up the price
4,the prize to the
4,it was all about
4,struggle to deal with
4,the thing that was
4,so i just want
4,who dropped out of
4,how to do something
4,a way to prevent
4,have to spend a
4,much of a price
4,pay the cost of
4,and its a good
4,extent to which we
4,we could make a
4,is another thing that
4,give us a brief
4,you see the same
4,a few months after
4,we used to call
4,into the habit of
4,just to be clear
4,of the ny fed
4,and so the only
4,never really thought about
4,that you know you
4,what the multiplier is
4,isolate the impact of
4,to go for a
4,the same set of
4,a number of issues
4,women are more social
4,would be likely to
4,there are other factors
4,seems to be more
4,of what is a
4,them to do this
4,what is the effect
4,how has it changed
4,or 40 years ago
4,there will be an
4,going to happen i
4,more than they would
4,the price of that
4,are so many things
4,things weve been talking
4,down the road it
4,a bad thing to
4,votes in the senate
4,for people like me
4,to recognize that the
4,think they should be
4,tell the story of
4,in the world because
4,is a response to
4,about the things that
4,interest of the country
4,the two groups that
4,would it be okay
4,is the idea of
4,in the tax code
4,a good thing its
4,a way of life
4,members of congress who
4,guest no i think
4,to participate in the
4,and what is the
4,its good for the
4,and what we have
4,lot in the book
4,of the big things
4,ought to be a
4,agree on is that
4,dont want to just
4,want to go down
4,increase the supply of
4,you are ready to
4,all sorts of problems
4,thats what im trying
4,much as they can
4,about fannie and freddie
4,it and other people
4,and as you get
4,to fix the system
4,guest let me just
4,i think there were
4,going to depend on
4,if the government increases
4,guest yes russ it
4,and i think maybe
4,right now if you
4,that it doesnt really
4,cities around the country
4,that you were going
4,not going to help
4,they end up in
4,is all of the
4,want to mention one
4,to the general public
4,we tried to do
4,tell them what the
4,we dont worry about
4,to me thats a
4,to do it theres
4,ways of dealing with
4,said at the beginning
4,and thats why the
4,who wants to go
4,think you could get
4,rid of some of
4,an economist to say
4,to say i think
4,to have their own
4,in the economy that
4,you know that you
4,think its not just
4,education and health care
4,this is the right
4,often the case that
4,you are really going
4,the guy who is
4,they are not a
4,that have the most
4,tend to think they
4,to find out how
4,thats what we should
4,what this means is
4,with a baseball bat
4,of the social security
4,way it would be
4,to try to put
4,making the point that
4,i agree with it
4,on the real world
4,saying you know what
4,is going to become
4,there are some real
4,the question is who
4,is one part of
4,fixed money growth rule
4,in the ny times
4,keep an open mind
4,you cant just look
4,we havent touched on
4,are very much in
4,out to be quite
4,to the behavior of
4,based on the evidence
4,if it were really
4,are going to push
4,of what was happening
4,like it that way
4,to say we dont
4,theyre not going to
4,the 19th century in
4,for the us economy
4,and i talked about
4,keep that from happening
4,people out of work
4,who didnt have a
4,been doing this for
4,goods and services in
4,version of it is
4,meant to be a
4,out a bunch of
4,high rate of return
4,money to the government
4,this is all a
4,value of the assets
4,to do which was
4,the only part of
4,the tax code and
4,think youd be hardpressed
4,guest no i agree
4,of them i think
4,about fanny and freddie
4,you can do anything
4,we think is the
4,depending on whether you
4,before the end of
4,the price of corn
4,the way we use
4,when you start to
4,over the last 3
4,that was a really
4,the two or three
4,a while but the
4,to call it and
4,because we are so
4,because of lack of
4,about the top 1
4,we should be looking
4,value of your assets
4,the economics profession and
4,scale of 1 to
4,and i agree that
4,at a number of
4,of the impact of
4,cheaper and more humane
4,the next 15 years
4,government is supposed to
4,up with a new
4,and so there are
4,ill be able to
4,not that we dont
4,about these issues is
4,have an urge to
4,not just that you
4,be willing to do
4,would be a bad
4,they are doing so
4,think thats the most
4,so i find it
4,has to always be
4,and put them into
4,one of the early
4,who used to be
4,be allowed to fail
4,that allows them to
4,shouldnt be able to
4,the way you get
4,if you want the
4,i was born in
4,are not enough to
4,what you dont know
4,that goes along with
4,could it be that
4,little bit and then
4,in lots of different
4,everything we can to
4,it is but if
4,were on the same
4,so in that case
4,that they are using
4,some of the magnitudes
4,from the beginning of
4,hard to say but
4,the government to get
4,a bunch of my
4,me ask it a
4,might be done to
4,for many years and
4,that kind of analysis
4,you have a good
4,all the time about
4,we do lots of
4,of people in a
4,but it was also
4,should we worry about
4,learn a lot from
4,about it that way
4,that a correct way
4,and therefore we need
4,i wonder how much
4,we have a tendency
4,not that they are
4,for an economist to
4,we would like to
4,the cost of insurance
4,of this is going
4,going to be if
4,didnt have to work
4,between you and me
4,on other things and
4,dioxide in the atmosphere
4,some of these people
4,so in this case
4,a young man in
4,because i think they
4,time but i think
4,back to your question
4,time you have to
4,a wide array of
4,number of times on
4,but i think when
4,digress for a minute
4,a system where we
4,we talking about here
4,whats happening with the
4,ways to solve the
4,high levels of obesity
4,and they come back
4,i think the next
4,that if you took
4,and i go to
4,the great depression where
4,i want to believe
4,that guest well first
4,try to look at
4,and is there any
4,you get some of
4,but its not clear
4,not sure they are
4,if you ask the
4,of all we are
4,it is possible that
4,to take more risks
4,talk about it at
4,the market interest rate
4,but we didnt have
4,than what we have
4,but when i look
4,those are the kinds
4,can be used by
4,im going to throw
4,but your point is
4,stuff going on there
4,of it if you
4,to understand that you
4,to do they are
4,those people who are
4,on the importance of
4,we are doing the
4,up some of the
4,is an argument that
4,in the use of
4,got to get the
4,going to go and
4,able to do the
4,is not a bad
4,think about all the
4,the results of the
4,because they are the
4,that it is very
4,turns out they are
4,has changed in the
4,it was only a
4,might want to give
4,to rescue lehman brothers
4,a look at this
4,a couple hundred years
4,incentive to be prudent
4,the small band or
4,and our political system
4,one of the fathers
4,of thinking about this
4,with one or two
4,that even though the
4,maybe there are some
4,way of life that
4,we could debate whether
4,had to do something
4,and i have been
4,health care and so
4,be the ones that
4,my listeners know im
4,would have the biggest
4,i know how to
4,with it i dont
4,difficulty is that we
4,you respond to that
4,what people say about
4,that there are certain
4,creation of the fed
4,height of the financial
4,to come from somewhere
4,doesnt need to be
4,do it there are
4,did you come to
4,think is very important
4,guest a little bit
4,are what we call
4,so its kind of
4,that much i think
4,an extended period of
4,a lot of dead
4,but this was a
4,if its in the
4,i really like your
4,when they go to
4,that he thought that
4,this this is a
4,has gone to the
4,here i think we
4,it is important to
4,agree that there are
4,aspect of it is
4,i think those two
4,most people think the
4,i dont think this
4,that way if you
4,what was happening to
4,when you say its
4,and what was the
4,which has been a
4,in order to create
4,that guest there are
4,want to know how
4,you lose your job
4,funny thing is that
4,we know the answer
4,that talk about the
4,just dont think that
4,going to be wrong
4,a man who is
4,the time to do
4,than it would be
4,are looking at it
4,i think that has
4,but the other part
4,people to do that
4,it is there are
4,me that we are
4,how far to go
4,things that would be
4,look at the economic
4,would you do about
4,happened over the last
4,way i want to
4,time and of course
4,to find out that
4,other peoples money and
4,it does a lot
4,that the kind of
4,also point out that
4,dont know how long
4,that you have an
4,to the safety net
4,there has been so
4,that i know you
4,of these people are
4,for i dont know
4,have to compete with
4,when i get there
4,federal reserve and the
4,are doing a good
4,as well as in
4,as well as it
4,is sometimes called the
4,because i think there
4,and they find that
4,about what you are
4,of course is a
4,is they dont know
4,how to make the
4,this is actually a
4,had been in the
4,of the small band
4,country as a whole
4,what they do in
4,top 1 or the
4,as well and the
4,to me they are
4,would bail them out
4,are things like the
4,get it from the
4,so i think one
4,theyre going to be
4,make lots of money
4,only a matter of
4,if we do it
4,time and then the
4,terms of fiscal policy
4,i am not going
4,if for some reason
4,areas of the country
4,right there is no
4,does not have to
4,in which case they
4,had all kinds of
4,sense of how much
4,interest on the reserves
4,we can fix that
4,expect them to do
4,when we are going
4,or more of the
4,creation of the federal
4,of interest in the
4,that we have been
4,countries like the united
4,to a better world
4,i mean there are
4,what might have happened
4,what it was like
4,because they thought it
4,if they had the
4,what he did in
4,think its a fascinating
4,the treasury and the
4,by any one person
4,i would say my
4,that you could do
4,of the average person
4,in the back room
4,and they get a
4,arent that many people
4,was the thing that
4,being one of them
4,that if you went
4,theres lots of evidence
4,there is no point
4,of my favorite lines
4,russ so before we
4,dont want to wait
4,a long list of
4,what he was saying
4,you know that if
4,by eating too much
4,part because of the
4,and they may not
4,are not prepared to
4,in the field and
4,who dont like the
4,of the range of
4,kind of reaction did
4,it is if it
4,be a great teacher
4,we need to give
4,very few people are
4,to me in a
4,now i think its
4,in the market that
4,lot more of that
4,it would be so
4,we are not at
4,to the effect of
4,guest right russ thats
4,dramatically in the united
4,where you are trying
4,put him in the
4,lot of room for
4,go through the whole
4,i dont think economists
4,i dont think economics
4,in the tms he
4,you know the whole
4,we should do it
4,he argues that the
4,they will lose their
4,talking to each other
4,what most people would
4,the world is that
4,in a recent episode
4,a certain degree of
4,what you are not
4,a question of whether
4,rid of the mortgage
4,to know if its
4,in various kinds of
4,the time and the
4,its something that i
4,ways you can do
4,think that we have
4,the mexican peso crisis
4,the past 30 years
4,im more interested in
4,then the rest of
4,of the people at
4,role do you think
4,know its an interesting
4,then i think you
4,in that sense its
4,about the benefits of
4,it to be the
4,to sit down and
4,and the ones that
4,russ before we leave
4,we had the great
4,a much larger number
4,just that we are
4,the conclusions of the
4,the result of this
4,themes of your book
4,of the day a
4,what it suggests is
4,is that i dont
4,hayeks use of knowledge
4,im going to add
4,on the ground to
4,i want to understand
4,be some sort of
4,be a source of
4,you have to trust
4,the margin of violence
4,a large effect on
4,the problem that we
4,i understand what you
4,thats not what he
4,i always like to
4,else you want to
4,make money in the
4,guest well i was
4,you are always going
4,a lot of fear
4,you say i dont
4,is really one of
4,checks and balances in
4,what we do with
4,of these things that
4,matter how much you
4,that all of a
4,around the world but
4,its almost impossible to
4,issue for me is
4,have to use a
4,so many of the
4,say if you are
4,we cant do it
4,at whats happened to
4,to run in the
4,process a lot of
4,come in and take
4,one of the studies
4,of the challenge of
4,book is the idea
4,that we have seen
4,effort to try to
4,to be a pretty
4,you say that the
4,at george mason university
4,we are a lot
4,to change their minds
4,were very worried about
4,a lot of costs
4,amount of money on
4,not the only one
4,some people talk about
4,your book is an
4,by the age of
4,of gross domestic product
4,going to go for
4,to be used by
4,because it would create
4,i dont know when
4,a million dollars worth
4,or not and if
4,to the grocery store
4,of the u of
4,recording date july 27
4,right up to the
4,think for a lot
4,yes i think the
4,has gone up dramatically
4,that many of us
4,fall by the wayside
4,one of the ones
4,think thats the kind
4,property rights in the
4,to me guest its
4,the next 25 years
4,off the table because
4,you know you dont
4,i think to some
4,what i do think
4,how much do we
4,motivate them to do
4,it was a failure
4,it doesnt matter that
4,it out in this
4,of the risk of
4,on the cusp of
4,which is not a
4,your book and i
4,of how development happens
4,do it and so
4,about whats going to
4,want your kid to
4,any one point in
4,are two types of
4,whats holding it back
4,we are kind of
4,us some examples of
4,a bit i think
4,if its a good
4,is true of the
4,what to do so
4,little bit like the
4,we had an episode
4,no question about that
4,in many ways is
4,even if they dont
4,i think these are
4,so i dont understand
4,it but it wasnt
4,i would say a
4,that theres a very
4,but is there any
4,had to do a
4,look around the world
4,of years ago and
4,in fact there is
4,going to take this
4,health care system and
4,first of all let
4,to go out to
4,what people really want
4,to a high school
4,on the business cycle
4,must have been a
4,what you pay for
4,that in many of
4,i know that if
4,done with the money
4,that theres no reason
4,of the 1920s and
4,have the option to
4,didnt turn out so
4,at 100 cents on
4,lot to say about
4,going to say is
4,left or the right
4,that in the future
4,what will be the
4,and you have an
4,dont really understand what
4,in other words there
4,you might worry about
4,be something of a
4,the financial sector guest
4,a different sort of
4,we dont get to
4,i think both the
4,the same time is
4,very hard to keep
4,a mistake to think
4,of how to make
4,problem and i think
4,a bailout of bear
4,very good understanding of
4,you can get that
4,too much of it
4,a very high price
4,has some kind of
4,are people who dont
4,of economics and the
4,were going to buy
4,put pressure on the
4,if we can do
4,we can imagine a
4,want to choose between
4,to do is put
4,you have a nice
4,i say i want
4,here is that we
4,going to happen so
4,people who believe in
4,sense of what the
4,you wouldnt say that
4,to do that they
4,the case of fannie
4,pulled back from the
4,say its okay to
4,of people have a
4,its going to work
4,started to think about
4,got to do is
4,i think its still
4,and the federal reserve
4,inflation or nominal gdp
4,it is and i
4,its true that if
4,system would freeze up
4,its true that in
4,us to a different
4,the whole point is
4,or you can do
4,if you create a
4,dont make a lot
4,just sit around and
4,is no way you
4,are ones that are
4,and if there is
4,i win tails you
4,solve the problem but
4,are right that the
4,to engage in this
4,is a symptom of
4,yeah im not sure
4,thats where we are
4,that changed in the
4,would be happy to
4,important in terms of
4,so we have the
4,a way to create
4,the data on the
4,are pretty good at
4,in the level of
4,its the idea that
4,but i had a
4,is not so obvious
4,with that but i
4,much higher than it
4,it depends what you
4,on whats going on
4,the problem is they
4,do it and the
4,of the important things
4,new york times magazine
4,you are never going
4,the other example i
4,is not in the
4,to say that there
4,have the equivalent of
4,but in fact it
4,a little bit is
4,argument that we are
4,of people who didnt
4,have to find something
4,a couple of them
4,whole lot of people
4,where does it come
4,the doctor to move
4,can be useful to
4,take the example of
4,to stay in the
4,is not the best
4,see in the data
4,at that time were
4,higher rate of interest
4,what would that do
4,have dropped out of
4,and the value of
4,thats the sense in
4,and in the middle
4,is a combination of
4,little bit about what
4,how would you do
4,and the internet and
4,but i think of
4,look at what happens
4,going to see the
4,it means that the
4,it must have been
4,within a very short
4,of what i would
4,those are not the
4,at this point in
4,of the state and
4,is there any way
4,or not and thats
4,that in the great
4,got all their money
4,a great teacher is
4,how do you distinguish
4,the reason we dont
4,that we were able
4,example of that is
4,the way when you
4,you paid for it
4,is that if government
4,there are ways of
4,so you can be
4,but they have the
4,say oh my god
4,could be on the
4,so its not so
4,money into the banking
4,be a matter of
4,that you can take
4,that will tell you
4,we can teach people
4,of the goodness of
4,and the effect of
4,from the international monetary
4,there is a moral
4,that would be useful
4,that i think will
4,stand in the way
4,to keep their jobs
4,through the whole store
4,so you get an
4,think it will be
4,problem is that they
4,guest that is correct
4,so this was a
4,they have no idea
4,that i focused on
4,i always say its
4,other thing is i
4,because you dont know
4,the knowledge embedded in
4,of how do i
4,going to focus on
4,change the fact that
4,but we did it
4,september and october of
4,to at the end
4,the world that they
4,thing we want to
4,which is its not
4,is because it is
4,place where you can
4,appears to be the
4,by that i dont
4,world that we live
4,because they have this
4,im skeptical about that
4,the 1930s and the
4,the part of government
4,new jersey and new
4,they have to work
4,even if there are
4,its true or not
4,we should be skeptical
4,people are used to
4,want to rely on
4,some of it but
4,it and you are
4,the credit default swaps
4,we could do that
4,on this program before
4,well there are some
4,suppose you have a
4,a lot of your
4,around the world to
4,lots of money and
4,which is pretty good
4,could have been worse
4,and when they do
4,there are only a
4,a version of the
4,and we are in
4,in the 1960s or
4,of them they have
4,not going to bail
4,and then you would
4,of evidence that the
4,then lets talk about
4,with what we have
4,so these are the
4,it can be used
4,the things he says
4,difficult to get a
4,be better off without
4,in the game if
4,and that they were
4,to do that with
4,not sure i would
4,on the spending side
4,take risks for the
4,lot of money the
4,be bailed out by
4,a way that doesnt
4,a bit more of
4,think im going to
4,thing i would add
4,happening to the median
4,they wouldnt want to
4,clause of the 14th
4,make money off of
4,dont know that you
4,that may be a
4,in all of these
4,that you are looking
4,seems to me is
4,throughout most of the
4,small portion of the
4,so we had a
4,im not so worried
4,they wont be able
4,and much of that
4,of the political spectrum
4,you just sort of
4,think we are all
4,that is exactly what
4,i think you would
4,we used to be
4,like it would be
4,talk about it in
4,of the creditors of
4,maybe it would be
4,the reconstruction finance corporation
4,may turn out to
4,out of it as
4,hard to get out
4,what we do now
4,of our ability to
4,of the supreme court
4,you are aware of
4,to that in the
4,looking at the numbers
4,root of the problem
4,that was not the
4,and i assume that
4,looked at the numbers
4,and what can we
4,thats a way to
4,some examples of that
4,you want to find
4,going to respond to
4,what you get out
4,my colleague here at
4,russ yeah well thats
4,it makes it more
4,the department of transportation
4,of the internet is
4,you have all of
4,so the way i
4,has happened in the
4,i suppose you could
4,ways to try to
4,it back in the
4,to be not a
4,point of view the
4,there is no market
4,make a long story
4,were able to make
4,read your book and
4,lot of the work
4,is some sort of
4,of a couple of
4,one piece of the
4,one social science and
4,well get into some
4,of which is a
4,wanted to have the
4,was put in charge
4,the study of how
4,in the last 40
4,of economic growth and
4,is the case that
4,and so i dont
4,through a variety of
4,put in place a
4,got to the point
4,worth less than the
4,imagine if you had
4,and not just the
4,about the economics of
4,to the banks and
4,that this was the
4,they get out of
4,you might say the
4,i thought to myself
4,to go to him
4,what it is guest
4,which means you have
4,of what happened to
4,by the government and
4,the start of the
4,right i dont know
4,states in the united
4,then they are not
4,the 19th century was
4,money that we are
4,the things you need
4,think that the only
4,is a huge amount
4,anything else you want
4,we step back and
4,she was going to
4,out how to get
4,so i am not
4,need to spend a
4,to be a failure
4,the case that people
4,their house in order
4,a lot of debate
4,how to use it
4,the obama administration i
4,and put them in
4,relative to the size
4,have the idea that
4,who dont finish high
4,between happiness and income
4,tell us about the
4,it right guest right
4,dont know whether the
4,and other things like
4,the cost of health
4,take some of the
4,other hand i think
4,college and high school
4,best they can do
4,that guest right so
4,that i talk to
4,to be done i
4,ought to be able
4,guest yeah right russ
4,now than it was
4,yeah i guess the
4,was very influenced by
4,you want to pick
4,is a very common
4,much more interested in
4,just get out of
4,were a little more
4,the system russ so
4,but i just think
4,what do i mean
4,the back of my
4,looking out for the
4,i think theres also
4,the worst of the
4,think you are exactly
4,would be better than
4,gps global positioning system
4,a lot of whats
4,you just want to
4,and filling them back
4,the time you are
4,he was born in
4,with respect to this
4,and thats great but
4,i think is an
4,correct guest yes russ
4,friedman and george stigler
4,we do want to
4,in other words theres
4,as you say is
4,as you say if
4,learned a lot of
4,of government that we
4,they have a chance
4,and maybe its not
4,more or less like
4,is to make it
4,community reinvestment act cra
4,current account deficit is
4,limit to how much
4,dont have the incentive
4,that they could be
4,because this is a
4,i have nothing to
4,i dont deny that
4,is a problem with
4,a different view of
4,a society where people
4,the idea that this
4,got to be the
4,of economies of scale
4,is an important point
4,russ its a beautiful
4,isnt much of a
4,but i think your
4,you could spend your
4,then you think about
4,that if they are
4,get one of the
4,is not only to
4,the labor market in
4,and they talk about
4,think whats happening is
4,what happens if the
4,the development of the
4,the thing about the
4,think about it a
4,where they try to
4,just dont think its
4,the government ought to
4,what was the reaction
4,because the banks are
4,to be very difficult
4,we can get to
4,dont need to be
4,that all of our
4,do more with less
4,through a number of
4,the demand for housing
4,and i have no
4,a central bank that
4,to be proud of
4,thats very different from
4,it is on the
4,a huge number of
4,well im not going
4,the money that he
4,money is being spent
4,i find interesting is
4,up in the book
4,one of the chapters
4,are not aware of
4,have to focus on
4,account the fact that
4,just take it for
4,really make a difference
4,the book theres a
4,what it is but
4,of course you could
4,fannie and freddie they
4,were going to owe
4,to do all these
4,the last few months
4,guest absolutely i think
4,born in the united
4,on the floor and
4,it for a long
4,is a different story
4,and thats really what
4,can see that the
4,so the only way
4,the end of 2008
4,didnt do so well
4,and your point is
4,to do this but
4,want them to have
4,really know what the
4,and then you take
4,in the mid to
4,of it was the
4,and you can go
4,the next big thing
4,just a couple of
4,doesnt look like a
4,it will have to
4,the data that we
4,dont want to look
4,opposite of the way
4,and the notion that
4,that i think of
4,seem to me that
4,people who did not
4,about how it was
4,only one social science
4,try to do this
4,and i was very
4,are on the left
4,started out as a
4,say lets look at
4,like that they are
4,i wasnt going to
4,course there are a
4,its true there are
4,in the academic world
4,were not able to
4,i think weve seen
4,to make the claim
4,something that is a
4,things we want to
4,talk some more about
4,you as an individual
4,that but i dont
4,it doesnt make sense
4,very well and i
4,citizens of the same
4,may be more important
4,theres a big difference
4,and we would have
4,and so forth what
4,want to give up
4,what happened with the
4,and things like this
4,a model of the
4,the food security bill
4,that when you go
4,to do as much
4,i think that to
4,for these kinds of
4,you know we are
4,but its always possible
4,whole thing is a
4,werent going to be
4,going to do anything
4,no choice but to
4,to start with guest
4,what do you recommend
4,was very difficult to
4,you go out of
4,they get a lot
4,to have to get
4,and there is this
4,guest yes and no
4,back in the 1980s
4,going to come in
4,money down the road
4,to do more than
4,not the right word
4,want to push back
4,favor of free trade
4,is a history of
4,the resources of the
4,saying were going to
4,some people are going
4,have happened in the
4,but what he says
4,changes in the economy
4,russ and the reason
4,that means that we
4,that and the other
4,to know if it
4,trying to make an
4,next question would be
4,than they are in
4,people like paul krugman
4,of time and then
4,so its not the
4,the outcome would be
4,and its the same
4,a little ironic because
4,harder for people to
4,with the same data
4,you can go back
4,there tends to be
4,have had to pay
4,the solution to the
4,get a feel for
4,of the reasons they
4,scholar of the great
4,or they want to
4,different way of saying
4,is a country that
4,of the commons is
4,the bank of englands
4,its a way to
4,you do at the
4,stood up and said
4,as a free lunch
4,for the market to
4,always going to have
4,for their children and
4,from 0 to 60
4,and therefore you are
4,one way to solve
4,that in the late
4,do things in a
4,with one of the
4,it have to do
4,that would be to
4,started off by saying
4,going to run the
4,are doing on the
4,think about in terms
4,have to ask why
4,the united states how
4,of income in the
4,this i think is
4,a lot of general
4,the penn world tables
4,i think back to
4,the highest levels of
4,is what they are
4,and local governments are
4,supposed to do and
4,variety of reasons and
4,come from the fact
4,of high school and
4,a couple of points
4,of my favorite stories
4,of the economy the
4,back in the 1990s
4,the things that they
4,and see if they
4,talk about interest rates
4,at the time by
4,you have is a
4,the price level from
4,would be that people
4,per year for the
4,the same time this
4,and they have some
4,as big a problem
4,to this idea of
4,but look at the
4,that is going on
4,if you take out
4,if you do the
4,but if its a
4,to the person who
4,nobel prize in economics
4,get to keep it
4,that would not be
4,hard to see how
4,at the dallas fed
4,the thing that really
4,agree with you its
4,but of course as
4,think its more than
4,have argued that the
4,to the problem of
4,road to serfdom is
4,time you have a
4,way to put it
4,willing to pay the
4,be a lot better
4,between the united states
4,the past few years
4,who you are and
4,it was important to
4,is probably not the
4,that was not what
4,and so all of
4,for a minute i
4,going to die at
4,else is going on
4,in the end the
4,what it would be
4,but there are others
4,is going to sell
4,russ and i would
4,one of them has
4,the power of government
4,that was a huge
4,of moral sentiments tms
4,which is an incredibly
4,before on this program
4,changes in the price
4,to talk about two
4,to make a choice
4,very good at this
4,not going to see
4,how do we make
4,he said well i
4,people think about the
4,example if you are
4,which of course was
4,well let me ask
4,keep in mind and
4,care in the united
4,be some kind of
4,by the government so
4,million in loans and
4,and if we dont
4,be a lot harder
4,is the work of
4,russ so lets move
4,foreign aid is a
4,should be free to
4,group of people to
4,the average person i
4,think the people who
4,so instead of having
4,we dont pretend to
4,part of it in
4,to be on a
4,you have people who
4,but i can see
4,to go a little
4,and how much they
4,say it a little
4,not what the fed
4,have banks that are
4,trying to deal with
4,that is at the
4,we are still in
4,that time there was
4,is it would be
4,years or 10 years
4,because there will be
4,and are willing to
4,in the past which
4,its an issue that
4,be there and the
4,if you make a
4,the world to come
4,2010 what is the
4,have to be on
4,as opposed to saying
4,the unemployment rate and
4,are comparing it to
4,world where there is
4,it hard for people
4,are you optimistic about
4,so on but i
4,i guess the other
4,going to be your
4,have a monopoly on
4,important guest i think
4,to be that you
4,that but there are
4,but if we are
4,the united states why
4,to do something for
4,the immune system thats
4,agree with you in
4,are going to double
4,and particularly in the
4,the growth rate is
4,the pace of innovation
4,what they are really
4,and the way to
4,money into the system
4,in the top 10
4,as you say i
4,trying to talk about
4,all the time but
4,we look at those
4,early 20th century and
4,the risk of some
4,them you have to
4,on the surface its
4,a time when there
4,the democratic party is
4,not going to affect
4,of the crisis and
4,to say that all
4,that they would not
4,of the jobs that
4,in the world i
4,its not all that
4,am not going to
4,of the benefits of
4,my view is you
4,need to get to
4,had an interest in
4,how can you say
4,the hedge fund managers
4,theres a couple of
4,guest i do think
4,are not doing a
4,the right to have
4,right and if you
4,when you correct for
4,of all of this
4,the book is when
4,are not careful you
4,cut back on their
4,a higher minimum wage
4,to crack down on
4,but its more than
4,it as a way
4,to stop you there
4,but thats a different
4,about it you are
4,the data we have
4,but what you can
4,like me who are
4,but you know what
4,on your own side
4,you are not alone
4,well you know its
4,for a minute because
4,happens to be a
4,saying that if you
4,the marginal cost of
4,when you are working
4,wants to talk about
4,could have done differently
4,think that could be
4,took a lot of
4,the economy and i
4,know as much about
4,of people who can
4,we need to go
4,about the health of
4,a big role in
4,so big that it
4,going to find it
4,a way they are
4,russ just to make
4,but its not something
4,has come to be
4,you read the book
4,that it was so
4,is one in which
4,to make a list
4,the united kingdom the
4,to cover the cost
4,off a lot of
4,but there are all
4,go on from there
4,so this is kind
4,do we know the
4,why didnt that happen
4,probably going to have
4,was sort of the
4,a lot of business
4,the war in vietnam
4,if we talk about
4,a lot of choices
4,but thats not a
4,people in the industry
4,would go out and
4,that they used to
4,the great depression in
4,would happen to the
4,2012 russ our topic
4,that we can all
4,lot of these issues
4,in that way i
4,one is in charge
4,do you think im
4,it takes to eat
4,for example which is
4,going up at a
4,great depression of the
4,of the innovations that
4,do you disagree with
4,solve the problem and
4,you talk to people
4,but then there was
4,out a few years
4,in the eye of
4,were in the past
4,there are other places
4,that it is the
4,in the market economy
4,pay off the debt
4,better than the current
4,a time when you
4,in the commercial paper
4,to me its a
4,it as a very
4,internal revenue service irs
4,i would add is
4,20th century in the
4,first decade of the
4,was probably going to
4,for people to go
4,the invisible hand is
4,money back 100 cents
4,across the political spectrum
4,no no no thats
4,a very good thing
4,to the stock market
4,of spending in the
4,and we know how
4,thing and this is
4,of the other party
4,make an effort to
4,you put a tax
4,it can be hard
4,russ going back to
4,do that but if
4,a fan of the
4,that if the government
4,that are very hard
4,when it came time
4,we dont need as
4,whether its true or
4,have had to be
4,believe what they do
4,or other things that
4,they are looking for
4,we dont ever want
4,of the adult population
4,think we tend to
4,case of fannie and
4,dont do it because
4,by the department of
4,think there are very
4,of the legal system
4,we had the same
4,of the challenges is
4,and lets talk about
4,russ the other part
4,are saying they are
4,be one way to
4,who lost the lottery
4,out what it is
4,what we call in
4,in a very short
4,about how much of
4,than it is for
4,what are the two
4,has always been a
4,paid for by the
4,much as i could
4,we know they are
4,the ideas of the
4,so he was a
4,thats what happened in
4,we are part of
4,take your point guest
4,well it would be
4,you ought to be
4,you said it was
4,you want to keep
4,if i give you
4,to say well we
4,russ how do we
4,they are ready to
4,what you did was
4,to in the book
4,have a big effect
4,those out there listening
4,i use the word
4,was a lot more
4,so there was no
4,then be able to
4,a lot of unemployment
4,going to do to
4,the alternative is to
4,and as much as
4,point out and i
4,so for example you
4,to you and the
4,the world if you
4,the driverless car is
4,high standard of living
4,the key thing to
4,but there may be
4,say anything about the
4,be very hard to
4,thats what makes it
4,the state is the
4,am not a conservative
4,at all levels of
4,i dont understand why
4,to come along and
4,you start with the
4,work but i think
4,really know what they
4,the idea that if
4,that makes sense to
4,start with what you
4,in that sense im
4,are many countries that
4,the value of what
4,the workings of the
4,if you do a
4,was known as the
4,by no means a
4,think that the best
4,on how to do
4,crisis in the late
4,that you cant have
4,the fair labor standards
4,of the american economic
4,not to be too
4,that one thing that
4,i was kind of
4,you lose a lot
4,out and spend it
4,are talking about people
4,in the general theory
4,i dont see anything
4,the chinese yuan is
4,as time went on
4,are going to tell
4,person in the united
4,are in a situation
4,not the whole story
4,the moment we have
4,you can put on
4,the things that makes
4,only going to be
4,last 20 years and
4,to lose sight of
4,you will not get
4,much of that was
4,money relative to the
4,move in that direction
4,that they are a
4,of the challenges that
4,on the relationship between
4,had a huge amount
4,to take another example
4,it but there is
4,relate to each other
4,and looked at the
4,a higher proportion of
4,incentive to do that
4,start with the first
4,its not a real
4,there was a recent
4,nations of the world
4,argue that it is
4,hard to start a
4,a good measure of
4,thing i dont know
4,is a math teacher
4,requires a lot of
4,are related to the
4,is a mix of
4,the terms of the
4,and its one that
4,russ yeah i have
4,is what the market
4,going to dominate the
4,will to do it
4,have to pay that
4,are in a recession
4,with a list of
4,the good thing about
4,win tails you lose
4,people to be able
4,do i need to
4,better to do something
4,you could say its
4,there are circumstances in
4,for the purposes of
4,lot of times you
4,because im a little
4,only in terms of
4,out in the united
4,about 20 years ago
4,in the physical world
4,and they are working
4,explanation for why the
4,the book value of
4,how confident are you
4,going to wind up
4,ever going to be
4,i think is not
4,you get what you
4,end of the century
4,able to do something
4,dont do anything to
4,for the us government
4,the department of education
4,to raise more capital
4,im not aware of
4,but it is still
4,united states and so
4,you can do this
4,know if they are
4,the best of all
4,is more interesting than
4,its no big deal
4,are people going to
4,see it that way
4,is what happens in
4,was in the air
4,thing that comes to
4,much less likely to
4,the dollar value of
4,have been wiped out
4,the fall of the
4,what that means for
4,this is a story
4,of public sector employees
4,so just to take
4,think would be the
4,about what is going
4,but they can be
4,and so on its
4,it is and it
4,years and then the
4,a very very important
4,not going to come
4,this is a much
4,you and i can
4,fact that its not
4,would come to the
4,by virtue of being
4,up their hands and
4,say i dont want
4,that would lead to
4,and i try to
4,some point it becomes
4,to be much less
4,i think you may
4,this is a bad
4,you look at people
4,to put more money
4,find ways to make
4,whatever it might be
4,control the money supply
4,who are skeptical of
4,some of the basic
4,the status quo and
4,you mentioned a minute
4,get to that in
4,had been the case
4,do they want to
4,to adam smith and
4,given a lot of
4,think about what we
4,that allow us to
4,its going to end
4,you may have a
4,and the funny thing
4,the opportunity cost of
4,what was the most
4,to stay in office
4,thats part of what
4,at the moment we
4,on it and then
4,was on this program
4,at least for the
4,and the rise of
4,a house of cards
4,and i see a
4,course there are many
4,going to draw on
4,occasional glass of wine
4,what we have now
4,the economy back to
4,be able to save
4,as well as to
4,myth of the rational
4,there is something else
4,it goes the other
4,i can make a
4,was done in a
4,do it i think
4,the easiest person to
4,to come full circle
4,because its not the
4,at least not yet
4,part of the city
4,is the price of
4,and now youve got
4,guest thats right but
4,well what about this
4,russ and what do
4,in the 1960s with
4,if its not the
4,you dont believe in
4,only one or two
4,of john maynard keynes
4,after the great depression
4,there was a problem
4,what they do they
4,trying to argue that
4,to do so its
4,they will get a
4,reasons one of which
4,that something like this
4,part of the system
4,thats an interesting question
4,the first point is
4,it would have a
4,with the current system
4,system in the early
4,i think its better
4,to be good for
4,want to pay the
4,it so i want
4,people in the room
4,as good as a
4,and why its important
4,is good and we
4,the function of the
4,but it looks like
4,hes going to be
4,what some people have
4,and of course people
4,use it in the
4,but not so much
4,of the things it
4,a lot lower than
4,that would be like
4,the federal government or
4,to people who dont
4,but if they do
4,of which would be
4,the gold standard is
4,of the ways in
4,so they would have
4,for that is that
4,the united states too
4,are encouraging people to
4,of the us population
4,give the example in
4,to do that or
4,in the past or
4,of the time its
4,in the book theres
4,we dont spend a
4,would say its the
4,clear the hurdle of
4,theres some kind of
4,got to be able
4,i had a great
4,and he said that
4,be used as a
4,book i want to
4,you are working for
4,going on and what
4,the nominal interest rate
4,with people who want
4,because there is more
4,here there is a
4,into the future and
4,im one of the
4,are very careful to
4,so i think when
4,a lot of stock
4,it this is a
4,it doesnt have a
4,it i think there
4,same is true for
4,might not be enough
4,we have to take
4,risk of heart disease
4,the problems in the
4,continental illinois in 1984
4,wealth of nations wn
4,of going back to
4,it would be to
4,at least in principle
4,used to go to
4,we know that we
4,what happens to you
4,to build a new
4,could be wrong but
4,the stuff in the
4,would be the best
4,not in the sense
4,i think that when
4,look one of the
4,thats a great question
4,i read a lot
4,little bit which is
4,in poor countries and
4,youve spent a lot
4,into the system and
4,to raise money to
4,dont think that it
4,was a result of
4,and then i went
4,and they know how
4,it is a big
4,it can do that
4,but i was thinking
4,there are many countries
4,its a very bad
4,who are not going
4,prices were going up
4,what i was talking
4,going to give me
4,but as a general
4,that there is such
4,that you dont really
4,russ well i like
4,you would have been
4,way to cope with
4,seem to be an
4,to jp morgan chase
4,was able to do
4,trying to build a
4,tell you a story
4,example would be a
4,and trying to make
4,this is true in
4,talk about whats going
4,of the stimulus package
4,the banking system the
4,thats the key question
4,to push back on
4,was a sort of
4,high rates of inflation
4,a central bank to
4,i dont think any
4,they dont have all
4,to sell it in
4,true that there are
4,part of the people
4,quite a bit less
4,there is a set
4,of the keys to
4,it over to the
4,is the financial sector
4,each other and that
4,because thats the way
4,the best of intentions
4,what the government did
4,the 20th century was
4,guest well you are
4,true guest well i
4,about how to do
4,go to the store
4,theres no point in
4,are subject to the
4,if it goes down
4,the productivity of the
4,think this is one
4,idea would be that
4,took me a long
4,they know they are
4,for them to take
4,put it back into
4,we dont know anything
4,and we were talking
4,by fannie and freddie
4,how could that be
4,with that guest the
4,the city or the
4,the power of specialization
4,you dont believe the
4,inequality one of the
4,do with it but
4,if you do not
4,and to me that
4,the face of this
4,that what do you
4,were in charge of
4,need to be in
4,is going on is
4,for lots of people
4,but of course if
4,but of course in
4,being one of the
4,im going to push
4,have some impact on
4,thought it was going
4,all the way from
4,are large differences in
4,got to make sure
4,you want to play
4,they are not on
4,something to talk about
4,im a little skeptical
4,what we care about
4,my sense is that
4,the things i found
4,tyranny of the majority
4,and the size of
4,if you care about
4,russ why dont you
4,the fed which is
4,time036 intro recording date
4,have to have this
4,on the web but
4,very good at that
4,it would be useful
4,doesnt make sense to
4,a place where you
4,to me that is
4,are taking a risk
4,is that you would
4,dont know how we
4,it a lot more
4,formal and informal rules
4,this idea that its
4,are all these people
4,dont want to know
4,but it is possible
4,so the issue is
4,i am not sure
4,of the tax code
4,to have to do
4,to try to defend
4,of the 1980s and
4,on the west coast
4,because there arent enough
4,played a big role
4,the things that has
4,to all the other
4,we do that i
4,is we are going
4,dont fully understand the
4,that do to the
4,the bank of the
4,make sure they dont
4,that thats the right
4,of one percent of
4,much more than it
4,you have a much
4,of what we know
4,and how can we
4,united states off the
4,dont know if im
4,russ its hard to
4,it because they were
4,then the united states
4,they did with the
4,is what we would
4,going to pay off
4,think thats true guest
4,i consider to be
4,russ but they are
4,things that need to
4,you go to jail
4,it will be very
4,of thousands of jobs
4,one of the really
4,air traffic control system
4,going to law school
4,before the war and
4,get out of control
4,you say i think
4,to be that the
4,do that i just
4,do this for a
4,expand the money supply
4,very hard to do
4,are going to stop
4,but i dont believe
4,rules in the united
4,i mean we know
4,the second is that
4,pay much attention to
4,to deal with and
4,most important thing that
4,it we have to
4,if its a small
4,what matters is the
4,thats the thing that
4,what they wanted to
4,is very much like
4,russ why guest because
4,to truck barter and
4,thats going to change
4,is but i think
4,think thats the right
4,we cant get there
4,the national science foundation
4,united states it was
4,we look at that
4,them to do it
4,years ago there was
4,you allude to in
4,and thats just a
4,of monetary policy and
4,to make an argument
4,of the world economy
4,a drop in the
4,it comes from a
4,that the banks are
4,want to be on
4,that to say that
4,you have in the
4,a fixed amount of
4,if they wanted to
4,i mention in the
4,a simple way to
4,think they are doing
4,but once you have
4,is equal to the
4,to be making a
4,is hard to do
4,all the things you
4,of things i think
4,up with is a
4,the last 510 years
4,the period we are
4,you think guest well
4,not a fan of
4,guest right and i
4,says that if you
4,very low interest rates
4,or jail than are
4,think is a little
4,they could do that
4,in the end what
4,only a small part
4,system in which the
4,and the way it
4,are ever going to
4,in the late 1930s
4,have to make the
4,and its sort of
4,nature of the beast
4,teaching to the test
4,but we have some
4,as good as we
4,their own money and
4,for any kind of
4,you do have a
4,you just alluded to
4,in some of our
4,know what that is
4,one view is that
4,what else is going
4,guest yes and i
4,that you dont need
4,dont even know if
4,and now we are
4,a 10 chance of
4,many of us are
4,for better or worse
4,he could have done
4,the answer is that
4,what he did he
4,make sure we dont
4,had it not been
4,there is a political
4,that you can create
4,not saying we should
4,about whether they are
4,therefore there will be
4,you believe that the
4,you can use to
4,the economy at the
4,all of it is
4,because its in the
4,how much do people
4,enormous increase in the
4,if im a bank
4,to keep nominal gdp
4,of our lives and
4,not so much a
4,of the points i
4,of the things were
4,much of a problem
4,thinking about these things
4,the second part is
4,the reason you are
4,we dont live in
4,long as you can
4,if the only thing
4,its true that its
