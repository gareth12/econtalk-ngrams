1,show up they dont teach if you take those two together its about maybe 50 of
1,that massive large event because the damage is not linear the effects of the damage get
1,right nowobviously theres a mix of technology and other things that hold it back but if
1,super cheaply and yet still nice leftbrain rightbrain podcasts people think of hackers as leftbrained and

1,and then begins a steady decline guest that decline was nothing compared to the stock market
1,about this podcast and he got me to read some of the book and don has
1,by yourself they have this idea that theyve never discussed mathematics with anyone these are students
1,the software they have also the applications and office suites but primarily just a platform they
1,that that equipment is depreciated but then there were other corporations that were paying very high
1,was a dinner party the night before the presentation ive heard different stories i cant remember

1,lionel robbins even with amazing reservationslionel robbins was a very sentient fellow but at the same
1,quite numerous i assume guest yes so first of all i appreciate this framing of the

1,different points in time peoples income tends to rise from youth to middle age your way
1,that is unclear finland is a successful story as are several other countries that have improved
1,the other places where they are and what you are trying to achieve there from our
1,an umbrella and tried to hit her for violating the social order didnt matter that there
1,that dispute guest i think there are two things onehe denies it nowhes never been supportive
1,speculation about what will happen in the future and supplies in the future the best answer
1,okay and then theres one last change guest yes and then the last change is to
1,anyway is to make sure that those other folks out there are made so well off
1,that anybody that anybody ever did on this subject found not only no support for wakefields
1,poor job at as economists teachers is that our emphasis on technique has crowded out an
1,we are worried about how to allocate stuff and how to choose a system where there
1,think charles murray makes a really good case in losing ground that the traditional liberal approach
1,now as an example of how inequality for the reasons behind inequality increasing in the united
1,time so conclusions will change over time wto japan korea developed with a lot of protections
1,make it clear and it is passed and dealt with by the congress whether its put

1,your own head to get all the way to the idea that investing in these guys
1,schools four people on a boat only enough water to save one who gets it should
1,given now these things are very hard to measure particularly on the benefit side and so
1,could argue we reach a tipping point 013154 re my point 013155 rr my basic argument
1,efficient pricewe lose the informational content of the price we lose the informational content of how
1,quickly there is an exodus out of germany want to get to switzerland england americaanywhere that
1,we would have a society that as alexis de tocqueville said would be enfeebled if we

1,suicides and instant deaths like that and then redoing the ranking the united states elevated to
1,them to sit around all day in an empty room id rather do the latter but
1,incentives including politicians puzzle youve done something really dumb and people are mad about it go

1,of paper written in florida maryland and delaware have done a lot better theyve emphasized other
1,environment where the normal thing to do is go to college you chose not to you
1,for mitt romney anyway playing to the base seems extremely risky all im really trying to
1,the possibility they are right but when people talk about them they never accept the possibility

1,the appeal of reducing copyright is the idea that ideas should be allowed to ferment together
1,the statethe way he thought about it is the way that i think all of us

1,it and capital thats the modern story not so much the story of the past some
1,to private property and business enterprise done so and changed his tack politically because of populistic
1,rates may have little effect on you how credit markets perceive risk framing of credit risk
1,functioning the way it did 10 years ago 20 years ago in response to a downturn
1,market doesnt work and suddenly i therefore accept that the government has to decide what we
1,had that right actually i cant walk into your house i cant walk into a military
1,have agency tension hayek called the human version of this a marvel coordinatedness without a coordinator

1,lobbied against reforms that have been proposed combination of subsidizing risks in the housing market and
1,how i work how a lot of us work if not careful the languid part gets
1,metaphors their own allegories for sure and in some sense make it clear but they fancy

1,put them on the internet for entertainment people would get upset and some people would stop
1,welfare you mean transfer payments not just aid to the family or something like that you
1,we have remained committed to magazines as a magazine experience we have ipad and iphone versions
1,two weeks instead of every 15 years so the interest rates would have to be on
1,very common russ well thats why competition and trialanderror are often a better solution than one
1,trillion this year some of that due to the recession but certainlylets go back to prerecession

1,simpler claim that ive made in the past which is that you should be empathetic and
1,place but that urban core generally something about it is very resilient and it kind of
1,when he writes his memoir he will also not answer that question but instead talk about
1,to make is that most people arent bothered by any of them and in particular this

1,some of them they were bear stearns and lehman but it would include goldman sachs jp
1,place i ever saw it youve got to be able to deal with that and so
1,point im no longer willing to assume that people will act morally russ oh i couldnt
1,you before by the way those are only the legacy liabilities thats the present value of
1,going to emphasize those facts and the real guts of it is going to be the
1,than economics where in fact so many of the solutions really involve just basic improvement in
1,on what others do but we were all made individually except for siamese twins and even

1,what he said was that life is monstrous infinite illogical abrupt and poignant a work of

1,sudden people have stopped wanting stuff intuitively i dont find that a very satisfying description for
1,russ roberts but i want to say one important thing which is ive had a mixed
1,not a good idea thats not going to happen and thats where we might really differ
1,out to brokers anybody can do it with no brains 5622 russ but im long beach
1,even greater no way to evaluate those two claims germany korea natural experiments otherwise use intuition
1,and bust which is a little bit hard to tease out because its one of those
1,theit works future it worked if you remember doing searches back in those days unlike most
1,not as if the fan fiction is taking something away from the series its only increasing
1,difficult is that who really controls the bargaining that goes on who are the people who
1,winning and the reason is republicans have winnertakeall states democratsill give you an example on super
1,are so my strategy is i go up and down every aisle thats called snaking im
1,that in the book fairly extensively point number one most experiments in fact all that i
1,peaceful labor settlement the last time out interleague play oh horrors im not against the designated
1,golden handcuff to keep them honest just the other day i was talking to people at
1,is036 intro recording date july 24 2012 russ when you combine the public and private expenditures
1,at least some will be behind in far more productive farms and thats how development works
1,system and bank money so as a result of the two weve had the total amount
1,sectorentrepreneurs looking to fund investments or households trying to savewould love to have on their balance
1,about the right kind of nothing thank you for listening 002103 rr our next speaker is
1,room even between 2000 and 8000 potentials include becoming more sophisticated organizationally and more specialization on

1,to monitor the labor force that was one route to mobility another routeeducation or trainingthe route
1,class where they understand nothing they are in fourth grade they cant really read they are
1,im still getting emails from young people who read my books tremendous joy books i write
1,story differentiation of product commercials tell stories rather than just sell product trying to get you
1,higher income they get a bigger dollar benefit obviously from that proportional rate cut but my
1,in those years in the decades before baker v carr was wildly out of skew with
1,re my point 013155 rr my basic argument is that we as economists dont have the
1,us constitution or might be thought toand we have a lot of experiments going on right
1,are constraining themselves or have moral power through invisible hand that affects us in our breast
1,of all possible reasonsto introduce protective tariffs which were championed first by alexander hamilton later by
1,so instead of 75 basis point margin get 100 basis point margin could be a factor
1,because we are organic we also keep some of the land in cover crops we build
1,company where did the cable companies come from they are voice over internet protocol voip but
1,huh there also might be in the long run changes in land use greater density russ
1,start even when the program is not enacted youve got that program then the standard way
1,you want to set aside today to fund that cost financial markets tell us very clearly
1,being laid off obviously and we dont know whether the hours worked are low because people
1,ideas that hadnt appeared in his earlier work to his belief system two other comments one
1,him of helping his wealthy friends at the time g w bush raised marginal tax rates
1,the ability to do business with anybody on the planet but how do you know who
1,know thats making me think quite a bit as im sitting here i think the measures
1,the help living across the street because now we dont have car problems they just walk
1,dont know what to expect who will be bailed out who should you invest in toxic
1,week assuming that you are right and we dont get to the armageddon the three things
1,subject and it was shown that there were some price or wage rigidities the veil proposition
1,other people have suggested sort of similar things so i would not claim sole authorship of
1,dont want to find themselves sitting on a couch with holes any more but their wages
1,industry the costs of me doing it what im giving up by expanding or going into
1,shoving hundreds of thousands of kids out of management schools who have confused concepts of management
1,sugar and putting up a barn we are aware of the recipients gratitude we can envision
1,better what do you mean we cant fix terrorism go fix it thats a perfectly reasonable
1,or truly so there are some insects that are social that kind of gather together and
1,youre not even entitled to a recent explanation for why the outcome is correct if i
1,wire and only copper wire unbundling and bitstream regulations that said yousomeone who wants to provide
1,laid equal blame on france and not just put the burden on the federal reserve of
1,64 million in capital so were fine because weve got 10 million in capital weve got
1,decided they were risky readjustment of asset portfolios is real not nominal but will there really
1,my job russ this is an unpopular position to hold that youve staked out in the
1,of business why did such a small sector have such a destructive effect why didnt bear
1,the doctor and theyll be diagnosed with some disease state that results in some clinical treatment
1,calling these things financial crises they are really asset market crises and they happen on the
1,policy of lender of last resort so it went in the spring it helped bear sterns
1,assembly of the athenians would be called in the center of the main city of athens
1,costs are extraordinarily high it costs about a billion dollars to create a new pharmaceutical the
1,get into the journals more easily russ so one suggestion is to have a journal of
1,best overall consequences consequences the way an economist naturally thinks about it is best summed up
1,respected voices coming out of harvardalesina robert barro we have this feeling that when roosevelt intervened
1,money teach more people than they did a year ago and the whole concept of what
1,that fact it boggles my mind but what im thinking of is some way to test
1,you know russ we threw out the fdci act of 1991 complete bananarepublic style in the
1,shouldnt get too hung up on the testing per se i think that testing gives us
1,of how economics works generally but if its not the case if it turns out that
1,the money came from all of those kinds of things essentially this is all in reaction
1,is an area that you didnt find anything that went against the received wisdom guest yeah
1,compared to equivalent nih scientists so the nih scientists produce fewer home run papers but also
1,allow them to continue borrowing dont allow them to pay out and the creditors are very
1,you need to try to strive to get back to the 7 lets put the buffer
1,set up a committee to lend and they recover loans and so on ironically the same
1,government would give them electricity discovered that there was some other reason gas wasnt selling 5552
1,cant decide whether republicans have better ideas the democrats whether they want a president who is
1,habit of talking to our inside group and then when we take that language and confront
1,harrington a colleague of his they set up this video game company but what is astonishing
1,and try to associate yourself with these complex views of different individuals is telling in its
1,company but the moment you create multiplayer online realtime video games effectively you put together a
1,we know about smith about where he lived what his personal life handful of works we
1,among both young and male folks so it wouldnt surprise me that a disproportionate share of
1,will be freestanding public sectori think in one of the chapters i talk about water and
1,smaller pie and so thats the original driving motivation of that theory so he comes up
1,in ways that after a while we come to take as reasonable but not so long
1,the fed youre an economist one economist says in 2008 we need to spend 2 trillion
1,that cleared the market there was no excess demand and no excess supply differed from thatargued
1,do what might you do what would be your announcements and actions that you would think
1,i wonder since we dont know where that level is for most of usyou should probably
1,dont have any money judge discharge my debtits a payment plan and so payment plans you
1,works bob frank ill agree with russ that the us government doesnt function really well there
1,are in the future so russ i think hed say guest i think he clearly does
1,my life and if you are hayek saying that of keynes thats a pretty big thing
1,types of conservatives fiscal sympathetic and blue collar workers who were socially conservative but who primarily
1,behavior now and it affects how you measure the impact because if change has already taken
1,just sits in the bank there are times when that keynesian worry about savings could be
1,computers play great chess first of all i would claim there are actually two games there
1,into a grocery store this is how much sugar is in a soda in the hopes
1,lawyers proposals at least to give them the best economic arguments in favor of them the
1,per se not about the american economy in 12 years but about the human enterprise as
1,to and we should absolutely give them that permission but you are rightboard members come in
1,me russ i know they come from the banks i know guest the banks made them
1,but not always teacherstudent relationship counts for a lot best learning takes place when we respect
1,it a good shot and then the quote continues he said hed done ithe meaning the
1,your grandmothers social security benefits etc all the medicare medicaid other spending obligationsdefense spending paying for
1,general motors gm is good for the country usually not especially right nowold quote someone being
1,thats very hard to tease out of the data so thats a problem with that textbook
1,that basis you put in place both public programs and public protections which make for a
1,a country it might benefit its questionable whether the poor farmers will it could be the
1,germans who had been back in germany the last few years baseball is the american shibboleth
1,it these days theres a lot of talk about concussions boxing is less fashionable its part
1,how do we go from the world we are living in now to a world with
1,addition you have things like the taxes where if you are gambling that theres going to
1,ugly and therefore i want the unseen pig in this case a unicorn to solve these
1,in what we see is when we look and see how markets actually function its we
1,very healthy market consumers want to get in on ittwo housesbankers catered to it greenspan icon
1,they dont have to go to the arbitration committee how big is it total of 15
1,its thought of as really a byproduct of enculturation that its really that you develop a
1,because all theory is simplification doesnt mean that all simplification is consistent with good theorizing to
1,be an unexpected outcome that would allow my net borrowing to be other than 0 meaning
1,and the reason i dont think it is fully appreciated is the fact that the cost
1,stuff become less prevalent surprised by how easy it was and how great you feel brainwashed
1,half pint of blood by midnight her fever is unbelievably high he takes a half pint
1,because its a flat tax and those rates have risen over time so you take that
1,i dont remember reading in the book is that its hard to make intimacy better over
1,districts to the point where many are larger than that maximum efficiency all you gain is
1,other things that are going on in the economy like i dont know the great recession
1,tranche or a particular bond that shorts like john paulson felt sire was going to blow
1,years of us housing policy theres a lot of interest in getting rid of the mortgage
1,case it just means insurance isnt really worth a lot to those people at least the
1,your familys life and all that think of this as maybe that moment for 3d printers
1,and they talk about it but its not part of their research really the closest thing
1,enterprise and i think one of the things we learned from that perhapsim going to give
1,of people from their college experience think of their favorite teachers as the people who were
1,arguments for the free market system cant be about productivity and graphs russ getting rich guest
1,all agree its a good policy that does not mean that that policy does not cost
1,way i think different sports have different sets ofif you ask people what constitutes correct behavior
1,similar forces why would it be that this one group corporate boards and ceos are corrupt
1,gallons of biodiesel or something which we dont make biodiesel we just burn the oil straight
1,years as a young adult yet i wasnt in any socioeconomic sense poor yet there are
1,four pillars policy major banks arent allowed to merge with each other view in the wake
1,system it could just be a mistake no its not a mistake at all influence of

1,intensively whatever they can do to get by with less workers but still satisfy the customer
1,for letting the price levelit didnt fall very much its not like it plummeted like it
1,banks now the basel system thinks about capital requirements using something called a riskbased capital system

1,of crowds many mechanisms by which banks can overcome the madness of crowds distinction banks can
1,others backs on the outside libertarians like those who throw brick through the window but maybe
1,something catastrophic but not that terrible it would be something that would impose pretty big costs

1,of different breakthroughs hes the head of research and development rd for lilly and he gets
1,in a more market direction where appropriate or we are just going to make it more
1,of jan 2009 jan 30 il just voted to remove governor institutions includes cultural norms political
1,idea that one source of computing would know so much as if data would be the
1,raw materials come from the united states but the idea of mcdonalds does and its not
1,been brought about by an omniscient central designer but we only use that language because we
1,institutions in competitive industries like labor and agriculture and the moment you start in fact to
1,by the wars driven by the reaction to 911 by the invasion of afghanistan eventually by
1,the measure you would use if i said to you show me why that wasnt so
1,it in 1968 russ yup guest and we didnt clarify the extent to which it was
1,more intelligent improved navigation communication between machines will happen in the background instead of having to
1,have gotten fewer lowskilled workers in recent years and finds that in places where lowskilled labor
1,the researchers discovered that even small consumption of wine and liquori think as little as one
1,area and disagree with you on another so i think its an incredibly important distinction when
1,same teachers the ones who teach in government schools and ignore most of the children and
1,failure is honored there guest and to an amazing extent really if you think abouti was
1,apart between that period of financial activity and the stories weve been telling guest so what
1,or 1780s in england real wages are not going up at a high pace until the
1,danger that some horrible person is going to come and abduct your child do terrible things
1,ideas just to take one example the change in retailing over the last 50 years walmart
1,to get people to actually focus on russ yeah and its really hard to tell somebody
1,lung cancer and maybe if we unplug the pharmaceutical industry that wont come about and thousands
1,discharge the important functions of the day so thats a classic case in which on the
1,crossing an uncongested bridge is 0 and so that person shouldnt be charged a price russ
1,want to start with the role of training and the role of practice in creating greatness
1,and preemptive justice which comes straight out of george orwells great dystopia 1984 but most of
1,guest absolutely so just as a sidebar i visited the swedish central bank a few times
1,able to persuade people that in the end a pot of gold for one is not

1,all of them bewildered about how they can find a way out the good news perhaps
1,to call back and say that you are probably not going to be working here very
1,arent so liquid when things get better i find it remarkable that ispeaking for myself now
1,i was an investor in medstory russ well weve heard of it guest i was an
1,data and confirmation bias charlatanism fan of ed leamer is our scientific knowledge reliable prone to
1,original structure on the grounds that when you are worried about excessive concentrations of power you
1,these horrible awful pointlessthen your conversational your forum is broken you need to fix it thats
1,i think underlying thatthe easiest way for me to think about this is steve jobs since
1,stevenson democrat split vote president on one level and congress on another doesnt begin to develop
1,your forehead and its a very important part of the brain it plays a crucial role
1,add a little thing here or there dont want to have a whole vote for every

1,the more likely youll be featured in the nytimes the university likes that so theres a
1,started to drop and dropped substantially a bit like the tides raising boats these are households
1,the employees were getting more than other unsecured creditors so in each case it looks problematic
1,work in this case because its such a low number but applying it foolishly a mere

1,york or for the profit the potatomaker can get out of love besides the person who
1,dont expect businessmen to worry about pollution because the pollution affects other people not their business
1,more aluminum not because people care about the environment but because its in the selfinterest of

1,with the women students you had to be building them up and encouraging them and with
1,england for example it was quite difficult to show up in a town in the middle
1,actually mean that in the most literal sense i think that people are addicted to the
1,my god other people are using that model theyve never noticed you definitely get a lot
1,that if it starts to alter how you do science and the pressures on what you
1,burned and killed and its interesting you mention the netherlands because i think after the spanish
1,if we phrase this the right way rather than saying you have to pay for that
1,example when the loss occurs it only shows up in the bookkeeping when you recognize the
1,and walk away from the mortgage that is known technically as a nonrecourse loan meaning that
1,get you some money the language that they use is really odd because i dont really
1,next to you says ill bet you 100 bucks that 2 people in the line have
1,to answer to or coordinate with russ you are not talking here aboutyou talk about these
1,the way they are structured in economics education the multiple choice exam the marginal rate of
1,little transaction that you do its treated like selling property and so theoretically you do need
1,farms and sent extension workers out across the hills to teach the farmers proper planting methods
1,are reshuffling the children around everyone wants their children with kids who are smarter than their

1,but he persists and he makes it and lets be optimisticlets say he did learn and
1,people dropping out of the labor force not so much new people getting jobs so those
1,is a sense in which keynes invents macroeconomics what is that sense he just started looking
1,guest on econtalk with a similar but not quite the same name as yours marc andreessen
1,but this is what he told methat after the exam was over that milton friedman had
1,he was a delightfully gracious human being russ well we were going to talk about rawls
1,econtalk interview where we talk about this explicitly the idea is simple the keynesian multiplier as
1,tomorrow is election day in the united states a week has passed since hurricane sandy struck
1,a vertical stack do that to perfection standard view of that is that apple made a
1,google people dont seem able to look to the past and see that in the past
1,are calculated have been negotiated in the past in a way that a lot of people
1,in the 1950s is looked at as a beacon of what planning can do other cities
1,can be in favor on moral or even symbolic grounds but impact on material status is
1,money changing hands other folks working literally 24 hours a day8 hours on 8 hours looking
1,things reset in a few minutes what had taken vandal 2 hours reverse vandalism also easy
1,it isnt true guest maybe its kind of a valiant effort i dont agree with nassim
1,the entire economy if the fed behaves properly and wisely shouldnt be a problem can have
1,reduce the number of resources that we have in this economy it reduces the number of
1,i think noxious markets share to some extent or another to paraphrase a line from tolstoy
1,who knows no comment guest yes maybe who knows i agree but if that were to
1,different approach for me the reason i reached out to you in the first place was
1,had recently built a beautiful new stadium comerica park which is a great great stadium and
1,capitalist is china guest well it is very capitalist but it is not capitalism as we
1,have are the same as americans would have in fact they dont immigrants typically are better
1,well enough to explain it to a nonspecialist i think that in fact there is a
1,authorities about what would happen to the rest of the economy if it failed but eventually
1,fed will remove those reserves in time worried about it politically talk like theyve got a
1,morgan chase and others took very risky bets that turned out to be riskier than they
1,you have 5 of them and there can be this you know what the payoffs are
1,survey cps gets that information so if im trying to figure out whats happeningi just want
1,the money the food often tastes quite good but is it worth 300 is it worth
1,i look back at the last 70 years of thinking about the firm im not sure
1,the same way those immigration folks arent going to go for they are trying to straddle
1,government less so well see could happen its a fabulous idea 923 russ you started off
1,prize didnt produce a groundswell of phd students using his work to write their theses i
1,modest of course but certainly the ability to defend the nation from attack i think its
1,got to make the decision and incredibly quickly using the local information he has evaluating the
1,us they are keeping it with us because there is a lot of liquidity out there
1,about 15 so youve more than doubled the size of state money but the problem is
1,they have guest the reason for doing that is i had become disenchanted with the progress
1,highpoverty school does and how low the graduation rates and how nothing we have done in
1,it again out of obligation or worries about your future ability to get credit but its
1,suspect but dont know that many of the people opposed to the stimulus program would agree
1,today that we dont experience today and it really couldnt have been done without widespread literacy
1,mediocre relative to the rest of the world guest i think this is really one of
1,pleasurable sensation every time they go near a rib eye russ yeah you hear an aria
1,it at some point look back on their life with regret for whatever reason the question
1,one of the reasons stem pays well isthey wont but thats really a challenge for people
1,it and ever the wit he replied well who said it was unexpected he was being
1,stigma from borrowing from the fed such an institution normally with adequate liquidity provision to the
1,state to pay so in terms of numbers what we did was we added up the
1,you see someone getting into a car and polluting does it make sense to say you
1,lower the price of safety which causes people to take more risks 617 what were the
1,8284 sacred laws of justicesome of best writing so far you think more about yourself than
1,hayek lines up for his final conclusive moment and he says the lesson ive learned is
1,they had to do is block canal development and in fact the british merchants in the

1,fannie mae bonds in the hundreds of billions of dollars and not worrying if its going

1,more in cuts but the more important thing is at the end of 6 months there
1,is other ways we can change our rules for changing rules stockholm is an interesting example
1,given and celebrates consumer sovereignty so anything that starts with greed is good is wrong its
1,not primed in the primed group theyd be given some exercise in the exercise words like
1,lightbulbs dimmer so that you can save some energy but then the screen is dimmer its
1,two features of the safety net would explicitly by statute have become under our proposal unavailable

1,that permission but you are rightboard members come in and they say were going to run
1,ive been interested in china very superficially for a long time i was very impressed by
1,falsehoods for the protectionist cause just keep repeating that the chinese yuan is undervalued or the
1,alternative theories had taken over marketed better keyness efforts of the 1930s schumpeters work on business
1,transaction costs its a system which couldnt exist and therefore its quite unimaginable russ yeah its
1,to do with the fed but had to do with a worldwide glutexpansionof savings that argument
1,right things to get us out of this and then the other one is is there
1,the lottery and now they get contacted presumably by some health economists or the state of

1,how this potential for personalization customization ties in with your work in the long tail how
1,very good question i give some evidence that there was influence from economists running to the
1,school in the us for example measure of closeness to global gdp in africa you are
1,know neuroscience doesnt seem to be able to describe it at least in terms we understand
1,revolution of computers and technology of a recent sort in around 1960 which i suppose is

1,hastened it whats alternative theory of what business cycles and inflation would look like under free
1,ed it just doesnt pass the sniff test for me to start with guest right russ
1,a specialist its very narrowly defined and as you point out the gdp statistics have a
1,new law schools and having current law schools get smaller obviously that would enhance their salary
1,and there is a whole series of people who started tweeting in character as characters as
1,live will have a lot more buying power the neighborhoods where bank borrowers live will have
1,couple of the examples you talk about in the book lets start with compensation so it
1,lots of things guest yeah you might very well do a better job than i could

1,three pounds of meat that even over thousands of years we in a sense outsourced imagination
