1,a kook i think some people thought that his work was actually immoral beyond being a kook russ absolutely guest
1,big number there thats the offensive part of costbenefit analysis that causes people to object to its use but if
1,marketsprediction marketswould give better answer because uninformed people would stay out of the market 2457 maybe economists are wrong maybe
1,those tax rates that affect that return to work across countries and we had pretty good data from the organisation
1,smoothawley elgar criticism not sure the tariff could have had that much effect maybe worse than we can econometrically measure
1,are the securities that we buy one more thing if i may add russ go ahead guest we are the

1,debate so back in the early 20th century mises and hayek were engaged in a debate socialistleaning economists the socialists
1,interesting cultural phenomenon maybe well talk about it put it aside for the moment you can sit at the table
1,thing i agree with you that artificially inflating home ownership rates especially through such things as mortgage tax credit which
1,can so far borrow on good credit issues about what the government do with that but basic keynesian point is
1,little ironic because aggregate demand and aggregate supply try to draw on our microeconomic intuitions about supply and demandbut without
1,what circumstances can you build a society where people working in their own selfinterest make other people better off is
1,or a real methodology thats going to say heres how you boost conscientiousness scores i do feel like for kids

1,today have never experienced most of us in america who are alive today have experienced mild steady inflation steady increases
1,in a museum though there are fashion designs that hang in museumscostume institute metropolitan museum of arttalking about stuff you
1,want to ask you two more things i think theres an important difference between economics and epidemiology which are this
1,like friedman tended to assume that velocity would be fairly stable if monetary policy was stable so they just had
1,valley or hollywood or boston 128 texas that theres this ferment these new ideas when they come along they infect
1,data the reasons the data are important is that data is the lifeblood of science we just cant get smarter
1,an interesting question how do we use this technology because there are lots of different ways to set up the
1,1000 you think only about that 1000 and all the great things you could do with it and you think
1,with everybody margins are small so you cant rely on these investmentsthe guy who is going to be providing canned
1,going to watch do you log on or get the newspapers or something and turn to see what the score
1,we would have millennium villages millennium villages projects russ scale it up guest similar they would scale up all across
1,you would get in any much more aggregated system and i do think that the same basic political economy applies
1,of land somewhere on earth that are good locations for building a city of maybe 520 million people could establish
1,say voluntarilyi mean choosing not to honor your promises because its extremely difficult or very costly or its in your
1,provocative title the earth doesnt care if you drive a hybrid could be dispiriting to some encouraging to others what
1,down about similarly whether you should stick only to banks well there are two arguments about what the lender of
1,my lowsugar lowrefinedcarb diet and im going to get my own little test and its one observation and its flawed
1,and its real its not reduced just because number one it doesnt exist today when the debt is taken out
1,our legal and regulatory system arent used to dealing with thisthings like bitcoin or things like the internet where there
1,effective it is thus that man who can subsist only in society was fitted by nature to that situation for
1,youve got arguments about that whether its the consumer price index growth of real income six months before but whatever
1,40 for you and this desperate person and youve expressed that willingness to accept 40 then to ask for 50
1,place and in a place like zimbabwe for example what happened with that hyperinflation is that eventually people just stop
1,contractors so theres not a simple story there but i just dont see the evidence for it not to say
1,are more than just collections of recipes as you point out in the book there are tales and stories and
1,but also benefiting from the medical advances that often originate in the united states which is a separate discussion 1142
1,generally true i think the part i would struggle with and some of this is introspection as i struggle with
1,incentives the police face many of the people are just trying to do their job but the constraints they face
1,guest i think the fact that the government has access to a printing press at the margin makes it more
1,in some sense you didnt need the experiments to be persuaded 3300 now as i said before if you do
1,in fact you could get those two results so thats when we looked more carefully at what piketty and saez
1,have to work very hard to please your constituents because youve got a big margin of erroror of corruption depending
1,which is pretty simple and therefore get to grips with your argument and therefore he sent hayek proof copies of
1,people sort of look under the covers to these mathematical models or whatever other modelspolitical modelsthey realize that people are
1,my own experience dealing with doctors and ive had to argue the opposite i do the same thing and were
1,can see that very clearly in the data 3832 russ so lets try to talk about that a little bit
1,and deference which means not seizing it replicating it at will not piecing it apart and putting it back together
1,if for some reason you care explicitly about our ranking the only way they can get ahead is by improving
1,me what should i do i tell them dont get exposed to negative black swans its very easy to remove
1,it was a bit of a fiction when it failedin september of 2008 lehman according to some reports had 2000
1,in the book you didnt have time for many many processes that i still want to study would like to
1,my house at the moment ive actually talked to a lot of people at verizonthe most interesting ones are the
1,my claim is that the average person has no idea unless they look at the data unless they look at
1,construction trend in us has been toward dramatically larger houses once they are in the index its controlled for macro
1,walmart is if you just have no other alternative then they say we dont want you to be that restricted
1,people he is necessarily led by a regard to his own interest to treat them even in years of scarcity
1,and so development started off being much more about soviet central planning than it was about market economics something like
1,going to have to make up the at the worst possible times 2824 russ yeah another way to say it
1,and those who are incarcerated represent the most disadvantaged segments of the population so we are excluding them now how
1,some academics can cherrypick they can give contradictory advice and retain the one because they dont have skin in the
1,because we need it bigger choices have bigger consequences but that doesnt mean by itself that it should be regulated
1,store its late at night this is the only one i can go into and so im stuck russ i
1,continued under president clinton didnt go in that direction russ yeah you could make the same story about our housing
1,said that its easiest to teach kids about money obviously when theres money in the family but not when theres
1,by sort of corporations and their interests rather than the interests of the people at large shortly after the financial
1,getting somewhat worse policy in order to achieve that russ and you are referring to the supermajoritymeaning more than just
1,back yard or mattress but the bottom line is that in poor countries people dont have access to these services
1,did we get here from there how do we get to a situation where so many towns are either literally
1,kind of shows that technocratic development when nobody could even conceive of poor people having equal rights to rich white
1,think about what are the possible alternatives if there are no possible alternative thats better then i think we are
1,the effect of some change we assume that everything will stay pretty much the way it is russ thats not
1,organization is there are hundreds of lightbulbs that go on and you cant stifle them the best innovation comes from
1,particular held those bonds in the assets and borrow against those bonds now the lender or depositors to these other
1,grocery stores and producers being the crew of the shipand yes its true that they go around making the ship
1,thats actually the conventional wisdom 847 so lets start with the conventional wisdom that they were attacking there was a
1,we do care about many times something more than minimizing the cost we care about morality we care about justice
1,or not audience has emotional connection to the people for 6 months what american idol does is what radio doesnt

1,in the armed forces similar number to support them diversion of workforce could say just another sector of the economy
1,they are common to the sciences especially the social sciences and especially psychology we have several problems but i think

1,they opposed womens suffrage the more it did turn women against them footnote in some dimension the largest antiprohibition force
1,of course is the obvious consequence once you decide to strike down slavery so what they did is they passed
1,emerges from that literature thats relevant to this discussion is theres this kind of vicious circle between a history of
1,pass on their genes we all understand that there are certain genetic advantages and disadvantages people have for health that
1,day cannot avoid the conclusion that hoovers was a failed presidency he failed rather spectacularly to get a grip on
1,forgetyou had the al franken election in minnesota was contested and i forget exactly when he took his seat but
1,the prime of their career in the banking industry was in the 1970s and 1980s they have been quite horrified
1,had a few and so that causal relation appears to be the opposite of what actually is the way we
1,on an airplane at the drop of a hat adopt an information strategy rather than a coercion strategy publish anything
1,think most people would agree its very problematic to compare say real income in 1900hard to measure precisely one reason
1,white paper on everything wrong with the american health care system volume and complexity change recognize that founding fathers didnt
1,donors were continuing to fund it rather than people who can guest well the donors funded the specific project this

1,us constitution means a that the average tax level can never be more than 4 no matter whether you are
1,is where he fatwashed melted butter and white rum so you kind of brown some butter so its delicious and
1,probably everybody almost everybody says they are not biased russ yeah they do say that i like to admit its
1,well again this is exquisitely sensitive to context and if i asked you if we wanted to sit down and
1,was i didnt understand the code so the other team had a big guy who hit me with his stick
1,telling ex ante story telling is really what we want to get good at if you said to an economist
1,typical american dream was that my kids will be wealthier than i am a large fraction of the population today
1,i think the paper christina romer wrote with jared bernstein vice president bidens economic adviser paper that predicted the 8

1,so good at subtlety guest oh i agree russ and its just going to add on this carbon tax to
1,capitalists and could pay themselves enormous benefits whether they were doing well or not and you actually compare how those

1,to put the corn takes a long time if you only make one needle every two years many skills are
1,the public school system did you think to yourself oh yes it is in which case maybe youve learned something
1,or not anything causes economic growth russ but that doesnt stop people from assessing it does it guest no it
1,sort of the heart of the book which is the impact of the size of the prison population and its
1,i mean this of course was the high point of the whole meetings for me because it was the job
1,can get a different type of estimate if we update the data series which is what will happen now in

1,following explanation based on what we know from various empirical studies in the literature so you are absolutely right if
1,the kind of progressivity we like that achieves social equity progressivity actually changes every year 3743 corporate income tax versus

1,make a profit as if thats somehow outrageous but thats what they do thats what we want them to do
1,could justify that the growth from this system hasnt been there and a lot of it is because there is
1,of priming for example weve talked about an experiment showing that primed people with agerelated words makes them walk more

1,other worlds could be that they are not used to it or that it is not the same talk about

1,hard to know what that is some obvious grammar rules but most of life loose vague and indeterminate have to

1,if you like the 5th book in the series called the collapse of globalism that the great victory out of

1,explanation i think in an evolutionary sense weve had a lot more practice with speech than we had before russ
1,call it a million to make it easy so the average person might make a million a person who got
1,social security system has thousands upon thousands of rules that nobody can remotely decipher and its completely underfunded its in

1,so these temporary merchandising displays or tmds that youll see we kind of customize to the individual stores to make
1,deal is not something that springs from the brain of franklin roosevelt comes out of conflict between roosevelt congress and
1,true i recently saw an article i think by martin west or something sort of things that other countries do
1,that they are arranged is a choice so lets make a good one one possibility is that stores are doing
1,a great study that did a lot of good things the design is fantastic we could go into some of
1,through the crash and just kind of kept slugging away through 2002 2003 2004 when things got really miserable in
1,april can you have those things still some states might want to move into march we dont know the full

1,actually happened and then we can speculate on what might have happened if the fed acted differently what did happeni
1,a lot of stuff in the interim for example there is a case called adkins against the childrens hospital from
1,to the median household median tax unitexcuse me guest thats correct now i want to be careful here the cps
