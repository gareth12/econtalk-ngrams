3,sentimental yearnings often make us wish to do
3,of the cruelest things in the world to
3,if we were to apply the unmodified uncurbed
3,present difficulty is that we must constantly adjust
3,money to their friends they just have different
3,we talk a lot on this program about
3,i agree with you in the sense that
3,adjust our lives our thoughts and our emotions
3,how to get the most out of life
3,the small band or troop or of say
3,one of the problems with that is that
3,some of them will have to do with
3,microcosmos ie of the small band or troop
3,the extended order to our more intimate groupings
3,one of the themes of the book is
3,up on the library of economics and liberty
3,demonstrate to men how little they know about

3,men how little they know about what they
3,if the government increases its spending by 1
3,we were always to apply the rules of
3,right thing to do is the thing that
3,not fool yourself and you are the easiest
3,and i think thats part of the problem
3,you must not fool yourself and you are
3,that china is going to get ahead of
3,our more intimate groupings we would crush them
3,you are going to get a very different
3,i want to come back to that in

3,i think there are two things that are
3,in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis
3,to a group of people set their hearts
3,to apply the rules of the extended order
3,i dont think we have a very good
3,little they know about what they imagine they
3,to men how little they know about what
3,things in the world to come to a
3,adam smith in the theory of moral sentiments
3,what do you think of that guest well
3,their friends they just have different friends but
3,on the library of economics and liberty website
3,learn to live in two sorts of world
3,our lives our thoughts and our emotions in
3,cruelest things in the world to come to
3,rules of the extended order to our more
3,80 million in loans 20 million in cash
3,come to a group of people set their
3,order to our more intimate groupings we would
3,i think one of the things that is
3,always to apply the rules of the extended
3,let me ask the question a different way
3,want to come back to that in a
3,make us wish to do we would destroy
3,a lot of people thought it would be
3,which the articles of confederation did not have
3,one social science and we are its practitioners
3,do you want to say anything else about
3,what do you think of that guest i
3,friends they just have different friends but they
3,lack all conviction while the worst are full
3,whether you are on the left or the
3,we dont have a very good understanding of
3,that inflation is always and everywhere a monetary
3,you point out there are a lot of
3,that the division of labor is limited by
3,like to give money to their friends they
3,take the job that pays the most money
3,all conviction while the worst are full of
3,must not fool yourself and you are the
3,and i think thats part of the reason
3,there are a lot of people in the
3,do you think of that guest i think
2,but sea levels have been rising for several
2,the last thing you want to do is
2,there are things that are the product of
2,for granted that a large sheepskin effect would
2,occupation where some people are better than others
2,valuable than they used to be which is
2,other things going on at the same time
2,dont have it when i get there i
2,because its the right thing to do and
2,are unable to engage in substantial gainful activity
2,within different kinds of orders according to different
2,think about teaching is to think about what
2,is that a good thing or a bad
2,how little they understand about what they imagine
2,band or troop or of say our families
2,a good way to think about it so
2,in full or something close to in full
2,and get your reaction to it which is
2,at the expense of the rest of society
2,and this is one of the things that
2,and i took it to epistemological grounds by
2,want to come back to this issue of
2,that we were going to run out of
2,if im a bank and i have to
2,and we are not going to be able
2,is that we must constantly adjust our lives
2,we need to do everything we can to
2,has a principle of motion of its own
2,seems to be a little bit of a
2,to be different and to take that dream
2,better life especially for their children and to
2,teaching is to think about what would you
2,theres been a lot of inflation in the
2,to report on what they did with the
2,the fed as a lender of last resort
2,it doesnt matter what you spend the money
2,that dream which every human being has of
2,much work will be done who will work
2,and one way to do that is to
2,a cooler in the middle of the store
2,getting the united states off the gold standard
2,moneyand your lives are going to be different
2,been divided into equal portions among all its
2,man wants to be loved and to be
2,and what are we going to do about
2,100 cents on the dollar because jp morgan
2,i dont have a straight answer to it
2,hit it on the fat part of the
2,china was a bunch of women with knitting
2,life theres magic comingits the magic of expertise
2,you want to say anything else about the
2,that when people are underwater in their homes
2,what are they going to do they are
2,dont know how to do it very well
2,factory in china was a bunch of women
2,there are two reasons for that one is
2,about whats going on and being able to
2,of labor but without the division of labor
2,the end of the day a lot of
2,people enough you are not going to get
2,to be a very good time to raise
2,so i think theres a lot to be
2,the division of labor there can be no
2,might like the book some people in the
2,the top 1 or the top tenth of
2,smith division of labor is limited by the
2,think thats the right way to think about
2,what are we going to do about the
2,theres a continuum on which we would judge
2,the magic of expertise and wisdom and moneyand
2,and we are going to talk about the
2,that we are still in the middle of
2,part of the book is based on the
2,i have talked about this before on the
2,just have different friends but they have one
2,estimate of how reproducible the science is and
2,what jeffrey sachs does that i think is
2,to claim that you can make things better
2,so i think there are a lot of
2,are things that are the product of human
2,do you want to say anything about the
2,really care about the health of the baby
2,that the us government might default on its
2,sachs does that i think is so destructive
2,waysand you concede that the program had some
2,discount rate that we apply to monetary benefits
2,goes back to the middle of the 19th
2,motto ladies and gentlemen serving ladies and gentlemen
2,think its more than that i think its
2,may have been one of the reasons we
2,well talk about that in a minute but
2,to change your life theres magic comingits the
2,is to figure out how it is that
2,to make the case you cant just say
2,to laertes neither a borrower nor a lender
2,must constantly adjust our lives our thoughts and
2,to have to figure out a way to
2,the right questions and involves becoming incredibly knowledgeable
2,rules of the game are going to be
2,and through your own hubrisit just its so
2,our instincts and sentimental yearnings often make us
2,between 45 and 60 miles an hour at
2,invest in the 100 losers you are a
2,dont do that they are not going to
2,is a group of teachers at the bottom
2,something for more than it is worth and
2,have it when i get there i fire
2,which every human being has of a better
2,are going to have to come up with
2,of them will have to do with public
2,a sin to sell something for more than
2,fortresses and virgins get to talking the end
2,the front page of the new york times
2,to every person when he or she turns
2,dont have to worry about the value of
2,laertes neither a borrower nor a lender be
2,guest well i think thats right i think
2,know what to do and i know a
2,to the assets that have been set aside
2,for their children and to smash it and
2,sectors as a general glut but some sectors
2,they going to do they are going to
2,of the 18th century and put him in
2,very poorly received in the united states and
2,that constrain the companies didnt fight them state
2,there was a lot of uncertainty about what
2,richest man in the world at the time
2,the different members of it are bound together
2,statement about the limits of reason which is
2,the 18th century and put him in a
2,many of the best hackers in the world
2,where do you think we ought to be
2,guest thats correct now i want to be
2,the united states is the only country that
2,property public administration and the rule of law
2,invest in google and you invest in the
2,the library of economics and liberty which is
2,builder to cut corners otherwise they cant afford
2,the person on the other side of the
2,chris talley president and ceo of liberty fund
2,got to be some equilibrium people will ask
2,its hard to put a cooler in the
2,the builder to cut corners otherwise they cant
2,we dont like the way the world is
2,to interrupt for a second im going to
2,dont need their local banker like they used
2,all the videos and 300 did all the
2,hearts on fire saying im going to change
2,the question is whats the best way to
2,off point we are going to use a
2,to come back to that in a second
2,i think we care a lot about our
2,because i have other things i want to
2,to disagree with you a little bit on
2,granted that a large sheepskin effect would show
2,just want to make sure i understand the
2,there is a group of teachers at the
2,united states is the only country that has
2,as competition arises from overseas the division of
2,i think its more than that i think
2,of a better life especially for their children
2,pay for the retirements of public sector employees
2,to do and i know a lot of
2,that they were safe things to invest in
2,people who are best able to determine how
2,for a very long period of time and
2,go away if we got rid of constitutional
2,most comfortable talking about it in terms of
2,themes of your book is the value of
2,to quit smoking ive done it a score
2,take risks for the sake of others and
2,think about what would you do if you
2,i dont know if im going to be
2,the first volume of law legislation and liberty
2,its going to look like you started the
2,they dont have it when i get there
2,decision to peg the value of the yuan
2,called the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act
2,the economy is growing too quickly the fed
2,reasonably enlightened group of people as china is
2,general glut but some sectors are healthy only
2,help the people you are trying to help
2,you have to go through the whole store
2,smith the division of labor is limited by
2,take up a lot of room in your
2,if they dont do that they are not
2,im just making the point that i think
2,the law as written is not sustainable the
2,in todays dollars when they are fully retired
2,but thats not what we are talking about
2,but they had to stay with a big
2,will tell you whether monetary policy is too
2,insight that the division of labor is limited
2,among young black men who have dropped out
2,from the advantage he makes of the buyers
2,or of say our families to the macrocosmos
2,critics lay down for what is sublime and
2,i think a lot of people would say
2,and yet in many waysand you concede that
2,what do you mean by that i dont
2,there is only one social science and we
2,want to go back to something you said
2,you wouldnt want to argue that population growth
2,i go to the bank and i say
2,be some equilibrium people will ask the builder
2,the value of the yuan closely to the
2,report on what they did with the money
2,going to do what we need to do
2,function of the philosophy of science to tell
2,jeffrey sachs does that i think is so
2,recipients of public services are going to get
2,dreams that never were and ask why not
2,is an occupation where some people are better
2,division of labor but without the division of
2,to dig ditches and fill them back in
2,harder for other people to play the game
2,is the last thing we have to worry
2,want to show that if your mom works
2,good will developed into trading as a more
2,a little bit not a lot but a
2,and so you have to find a solution
2,principle of banking which is know your customer
2,prices go up people find more ways to
2,rap video called the fight of the century
2,of economics is to illustrate to men how
2,will be most comfortable talking about it in
2,hundreds of millions of people in the world
2,only from the advantage he makes of the
2,i want to come back to this issue
2,willing to use the power of the state
2,would balance the budget over the life of
2,for the doctor to move then the doctor
2,2013 russ were going to talk today about
2,ferguson things that are the result of human
2,works even if you dont believe in it
2,pay for dinner again and youll never get
2,dont have a thermometer that can tell us
2,to make sure that air travel is safe
2,into trading as a more equitable means of
2,will developed into trading as a more equitable
2,you have low skill and you live in
2,you dont know that you are russ roberts
2,russ let me ask you a question about
2,and thats the kind of behavior that parents
2,i know many people over the age of
2,the idea that you have to have a
2,using the internet to increase their power and
2,dont have any interest in being able to
2,thats why they are asking for scaling up
2,they spend a bit of it to get
2,thoughts and our emotions in order to live
2,involves becoming incredibly knowledgeable about these fields yourself
2,understand about what they imagine they can design
2,constantly adjust our lives our thoughts and our
2,they dont do that they are not going
2,their hearts on fire saying im going to
2,dream which every human being has of a
2,that there are fewer and fewer jobs in
2,that we are coming to the end of
2,and you have to worry about that but
2,the last thing we have to worry about
2,what would have happened if the government had
2,didnt fight them state by state as competition
2,can throw a baseball 100 miles an hour
2,had the earth been divided into equal portions
2,have one friend in common which is the
2,george mason when i look to the future
2,you concede that the program had some positive
2,trading as a more equitable means of maximizing
2,is to think about what would you do
2,a lot of whats going on is that
2,some sectors as a general glut but some
2,who are best able to determine how many
2,difficulty is that we must constantly adjust our
2,companies didnt fight them state by state as
2,little they understand about what they imagine they
2,we dont do that anywhere else in the
2,is increasingly hard as science becomes increasingly networked
2,i dont have to give you any reasons
2,are led as if by an invisible hand
2,orders according to different rules if we were
2,russ lets shift gears i want to talk
2,that there is such a thing as the
2,are the product of human action but not
2,especially for their children and to smash it
2,there are a lot of people who are
2,our topic for today is a recent article
2,overseas the division of the pie is harder
2,the way i dont want to suggest that
2,rich people are happier than poor people the
2,weighed all the facts and i came to
2,it and through your own hubrisit just its
2,who cant get out of bed in the
2,the minds of people on your own side
2,your lives are going to be different and
2,weve talked about a number of times on
2,or it could be that the stimulus package
2,the more i thought about it the more
2,state as competition arises from overseas the division
2,point out in the book one of the
2,dont think thats the right way to think
2,mark twain said its easy to quit smoking
2,i dont think you talk about in the
2,were going to have to figure out a
2,i dont think its an accident that we
2,that interest rates are not a reliable indicator
2,the reality of what goes on in the
2,it is led by a reasonably enlightened group
2,and when they get it they like it
2,i weighed all the facts and i came
2,its easy to quit smoking ive done it
2,its only a matter of time before we
2,so i think theres something to john taylors
2,but i think a lot of it is
2,asking the right people the right questions and
2,college to think otherwise is the pretense of
2,getting and spending we lay waste our powers
2,the typical large failure fraud was invariably present
2,that the best way to think about teaching
2,who has been a guest on this program
2,that you are unable to engage in substantial
2,say we just need to spend more and
2,great that you can send your shirt out
2,there is a lot of uncertainty about what
2,you can master in college to think otherwise
2,and i say how many of you have
2,some positive effectsbut in many ways its one
2,curious task of economics is to illustrate to
2,what are your thoughts on how we might
2,if you have low skill and you live
2,and i think its one of the most
2,by the end of the evening they all
2,one of the things i found interesting about
2,hard to predict how these things will evolve
2,the discount rate that we apply to monetary
2,that the right thing to do is the
2,going on in the united states right now
2,one of the major themes of the book
2,the actual history of lighthouses in great britain
2,in the book is that a lot of
2,as our instincts and sentimental yearnings often make
2,cant get out of bed in the morning
2,equilibrium people will ask the builder to cut
2,expertise and wisdom and moneyand your lives are
2,question is what should we do about it
2,been a lot of inflation in the energy
2,is left for parents to be increasing the
2,to take that into account you cant just
2,but without the division of labor there can
2,left for parents to be increasing the similarity
2,the united states and elsewhere in the world
2,it will be the end of the world
2,shouldnt be that hard in the first place
2,asked what are firms but why are there
2,in google and you invest in the 100
2,it would be wrong for me not to
2,capitalist who had the opportunity to invest in
2,got all their money back 100 cents on
2,a sharp increase in the price of oil
2,and i want to come back to that
2,just how far to go in terms of
2,before i do that i want you to
2,have to take that into account you cant
2,and if you are the son of a
2,some equilibrium people will ask the builder to
2,a good thing might be a bad thing
2,a reasonably enlightened group of people as china
2,our topic for today is your book the
2,families to the macrocosmos our wider civilisation as
2,that we must constantly adjust our lives our
2,and wisdom and moneyand your lives are going
2,went all the way to the supreme court
2,budget over the life of the business cycle
2,of labor being limited by the extent of
2,it when i get there i fire them
2,that the drugs dont do anything the drugs
2,dont we want everyone to have health insurance
2,was a bunch of women with knitting needles
2,that in a second but i want to
2,of course its gotten a lot more expensive
2,but they say it works even if you
2,inconsistent with saying the fed did too little
2,if you believe that the deficit spending is
2,think that the best way to think about
2,many waysand you concede that the program had
2,bit to the left of the house delegation
2,are your thoughts on that guest well i
2,to cut corners otherwise they cant afford the
2,russ im just making the point that i
2,im not sure its ever going to be
2,what happened on piper alpha the more i
2,one of the things i point out in
2,when it is led by a reasonably enlightened
2,would be looking at the quantity of money
2,23 2013 russ our topic for today is
2,to different rules if we were to apply
2,what does this have to do with the
2,and recipients of public services are going to
2,simultaneously within different kinds of orders according to
2,1982 with the tax equity and fiscal responsibility
2,the advantage he makes of the buyers want
2,but before i do that i want you
2,you dont pay people enough you are not
2,inside every fat person is a fatter person
2,what we are talking about in terms of
2,the more people you can exchange with the
2,spend a lot of time fascinated by the
2,change your life theres magic comingits the magic
2,in that space between the individual and the
2,you point out in the book there are
2,services where you pay your own money and
2,kill the goose that lays the golden egg
2,you talk at the beginning of the book
2,from overseas the division of the pie is
2,russ i couldnt agree with you more i
2,its one of the cruelest things in the
2,we still need to be doing everything we
2,to say its okay to steal car radios
2,milk is at the back of the store
2,kinds of orders according to different rules if
2,want to live in a world where its
2,there is a lot of stuff in the
2,the human capital model and the signaling model
2,if you have to pay someone to take
2,dont know what to do and i know
2,because its a problem that gets worse the
2,think that the best thing to broadcast is
2,order to live simultaneously within different kinds of
2,of the things i really like about your
2,questions and involves becoming incredibly knowledgeable about these
2,waves of bank failures with lots of losses
2,one of the things that comes through in
2,friend in common which is the financial sector
2,to do we would destroy it yet if
2,competition arises from overseas the division of the
2,will ask the builder to cut corners otherwise
2,is due to the fact that we subsidize
2,when i think about it i think about
2,the people who ran the library in alexandria
2,wealth of nations or the theory of moral
2,dont be so arrogant to think that you
2,poloniuss advice to laertes neither a borrower nor
2,and i know many people over the age
2,the unmodified uncurbed rules of the microcosmos ie
2,they are led by an invisible hand to
2,it would be a mistake to think that
2,in his presidential address to the american economic
2,master in college to think otherwise is the
2,our emotions in order to live simultaneously within
2,much more likely to be in prison or
2,destroy it yet if we were always to
2,them state by state as competition arises from
2,is how much should i charge for it
2,and i dont think we have a very
2,the other point i want to make is
2,be more like france or less like france
2,every venture capitalist who had the opportunity to
2,large sheepskin effect would show that signaling was
2,yourself and that is increasingly hard as science
2,want to live in a world where people
2,what are firms but why are there firms
2,a large sheepskin effect would show that signaling
2,his presidential address to the american economic association
2,the right people the right questions and involves
2,ask the builder to cut corners otherwise they
2,thats too much im not going to pay
2,are going to be different and to take
2,just its so depressing partly because those arguments
2,any is left for parents to be increasing
2,said its easy to quit smoking ive done
2,or immunities clause of the 14th amendment which
2,going to be different and to take that
2,all the different members of it are bound
2,in order to live simultaneously within different kinds
2,you walk into a hospital and say im
2,one of the primary explanations for that is
2,at george mason when i look to the
2,to engage in substantial gainful activity in the
2,friends but they have one friend in common
2,people are happier than poor people the second
2,we spend a lot of time in the
2,too much im not going to pay that
2,of expertise and wisdom and moneyand your lives
2,are going to make a lot of money
2,out is that if you look at the
2,right now lets put that to the side
2,dont necessarily take the job that pays the
2,you invest in the 100 losers you are
2,a lot about how much difference there is
2,immunities clause of the 14th amendment which says
2,go around to a bunch of people and
2,to be some equilibrium people will ask the
2,spend a lot of time in the book
2,illustrate to men how little they really know
2,in the case of the horse or this
2,a statement about the limits of reason which
2,it but as you point out they are
2,and that is increasingly hard as science becomes
2,would have the biggest banks in the world
2,human being has of a better life especially
2,troop or of say our families to the
2,on the one hand on the other hand
2,the question is what do you do about
2,the fifth book of the wealth of nations
2,i want to go back to the builder
2,you would balance the budget over the life
2,topic for today is a recent article you
2,wisdom and moneyand your lives are going to
2,in many ways its one of the cruelest
2,question is how much should i charge for
2,the umps would come over and yell at
2,the house collapses and kills the owner of
2,the stock price goes up i make money
2,that and then i want to move on
2,i think one of the things that we
2,the rules of the game are going to
2,if we could just put more money into
2,to figure out whats going on in the
2,i dont think thats the right way to
2,because the more people you can exchange with
2,up to the trend line we were on
2,google and you invest in the 100 losers
2,adam ferguson things that are the result of
2,because we dont like the way the world
2,right questions and involves becoming incredibly knowledgeable about
2,its just a matter of time before we
2,to get into the nuts and bolts of
2,was very poorly received in the united states
2,so you have to find a solution to
2,were going to talk about a number of
2,in some sectors as a general glut but
2,a high school math teacher and i think
2,no federal deposit insurance or other federal government
2,lets shift gears i want to talk about
2,and to take that dream which every human
2,but the fact of the matter is that
2,of people thought it would be killed by
2,many ways its one of the cruelest things
2,the companies didnt fight them state by state
2,im curious what you think is going to
2,i think thats true of a lot of
2,it harder for other people to play the
2,we have a lot more to talk about
2,hard as science becomes increasingly networked and crossdisciplined
2,fight them state by state as competition arises
2,the price didnt tell you to step aside
2,in the book there are a lot of
2,effectsbut in many ways its one of the
2,there somebody would have picked it up already
2,i think weve just scratched the surface on
2,basic principle of banking which is know your
2,here at the u of alabama in huntsville
2,arises from overseas the division of the pie
2,enough you are not going to get motivation
2,judgment about whats the right thing to do
2,and i dont know how much of the
2,students who go to the ivy league schools
2,as a general glut but some sectors are
2,benjamin franklin when fortresses and virgins get to
2,the economy is finally starting to recover and
2,something for more than it is worth well
2,number of people who are going to be
2,in two sorts of world at once italics
2,not only in the united states but globally
2,go back to something you said a minute
2,back up to the trend line we were
2,your own hubrisit just its so depressing partly
2,top 1 or the top tenth of 1
2,as a share of gdp back to where
2,i dont think we know as much about
2,and virgins get to talking the end is
2,that are called principle plus interest payments on
2,that a large sheepskin effect would show that
2,live in a world where its okay to
2,we had played by the rules of capitalism
2,be loved and to be lovely we want
2,wider civilisation as our instincts and sentimental yearnings
2,one of the things he says is that
2,and our emotions in order to live simultaneously
2,more valuable than they used to be which
2,in the test group and the control group
2,cant do this and you cant do that
2,think you talk about in the book is
2,a more equitable means of maximizing individual satisfaction
2,insurance or other federal government protection or guarantees
2,2013 russ our topic for today is the
2,our wider civilisation as our instincts and sentimental
2,you dont need to go back and figure
2,is only one social science and we are
2,i want to say one more thing about
2,increasingly hard as science becomes increasingly networked and
2,how did you get to where you are
2,get up in front of the class and
2,to worry about the value of their investments
2,what does that mean what it means is
2,and the second part of the story is
2,wants to be loved and to be lovely
2,to make the pie as big as possible
2,the videos and 300 did all the work
2,without the division of labor there can be
2,4 2012 russ were going to talk about
2,them what we can do is we can
2,no division of labor but without the division
2,then you have to ask what is the
2,careful to come on time and if he
2,about the limits of reason which is a
2,example of how to think about data and
2,lives are going to be different and to
2,to extract money from the rest of us
2,of them will do it because of the
2,its not free to use the price system
2,anything else you want to add guest well
2,can master in college to think otherwise is
2,but when it is led by a reasonably
2,macrocosmos our wider civilisation as our instincts and
2,universe of people who take the test in
2,what to do and i know a lot
2,or troop or of say our families to
2,was at the height of the financial crisis
2,be guided as if by an invisible hand
2,does that i think is so destructive and
2,hayek said the curious task of economics is
2,house collapses and kills the owner of the
2,of say our families to the macrocosmos our
2,dont need to go back and figure out
2,or how satisfied are you with your life
2,the pie is not as big as it
2,thats the right way to think about it
2,liberty private property public administration and the rule
2,and kills the owner of the house the
2,chuck williams dean of butler universitys college of
2,if they dont have it when i get
2,it was only a matter of time before
2,chrysler a very big incentive to roll out
2,at the end of the day a lot
2,be done who will work how will compensation
2,with the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act
2,two sorts of world at once italics original
2,at the london school of economics lse he
2,are a large part of the 1 they
2,party might like the book some people in
2,in a world in which health is getting
2,positive effectsbut in many ways its one of
2,they have one friend in common which is
2,labor being limited by the extent of the
2,the other point i want to make which
2,economics is to illustrate to men how little
2,people the right questions and involves becoming incredibly
2,a lot of the world is obsessed with
2,the product of human action but not human
2,and involves becoming incredibly knowledgeable about these fields
2,things that are the product of human action
2,were to apply the unmodified uncurbed rules of
2,going to read another quote from the book
2,have to worry about the value of their
2,do in this book is to say that
2,you have to take that into account you
2,dream dreams that never were and ask why
2,sin to sell something for more than it
2,what i talk about in the book is
2,in the late 19th century and early 20th
2,they say it works even if you dont
2,privileges or immunities clause of the 14th amendment
2,going to have to figure out a way
2,the people who are best able to determine
2,russ before introducing todays guest i want to
2,what the rules of the game are going
2,unmodified uncurbed rules of the microcosmos ie of
2,i think is at least part of the
2,set their hearts on fire saying im going
2,one of the things i talk about in
2,in the first part of the 20th century
2,so depressing partly because those arguments tend to
2,they have a lot of political power in
2,are your thoughts on that guest well this
2,as prices go up people find more ways
2,not publishable either guest well thats the problem
2,the flip side of that though is that
2,the federal home loan bank of san francisco
2,lay down for what is sublime and elegant
2,relative to the assets that have been set
2,say that the right thing to do is
2,concede that the program had some positive effectsbut
2,in 10 chance that we are going to
2,p 18 part of our present difficulty is
2,will be done who will work how will
2,lot of what you are talking about is
2,best way to think about teaching is to
2,back to something you said a minute ago
2,be a good thing might be a bad
2,what are your thoughts on where we are
2,do you think thats a good choice the
2,your neighbor over the head and take his
2,if you look at the history of the
2,as a jumping off point we are going
2,theres got to be some equilibrium people will
2,you have a lot of interesting things to
2,look you know as well as i do
2,going to change your life theres magic comingits
2,to be loved and to be lovely we
2,they spend a lot of time trying to
2,it yet if we were always to apply
2,you dont put all your eggs in one
2,but at the end of the day i
2,get to talking the end is in sight
2,a lot of inflation in the energy sector
2,is good for you i dont like it
2,dont spend a lot of time talking about
2,ways its one of the cruelest things in
2,part of the revolving door in a literal
2,and then i had a 2year postdoc at
2,are firms but why are there firms and
2,and then all of a sudden they are
2,the budget over the life of the business
2,which would seem to be a good thing
2,different kinds of orders according to different rules
2,one of the things that we have seen
2,division of labor being limited by the extent
2,law that abridges the privileges or immunities of
2,for dinner again and youll never get an
2,if you dont pay people enough you are
2,venture capitalist who had the opportunity to invest
2,could be a group of people who say
2,the cool thing about google is that it
2,unable to engage in substantial gainful activity in
2,im going to have to disagree with you
2,get your reaction to it which is that
2,cut corners otherwise they cant afford the house
2,and moneyand your lives are going to be
2,thought the world was coming to an end
2,you want to make the pie as big
2,like the students who go to the ivy
2,what do you think of the argument that
2,that the manufacturing sector in the united states
2,from the point of view of the recipient
2,to be ruled by the majority rule of
2,there are a bunch of things that are
2,and its just a matter of time before
2,these fields yourself and that is increasingly hard
2,the job openings and labor turnover survey jolts
2,2013 russ our topic for today is a
2,so im going to have to ask you
2,weve talked about many times on this program
2,the difference between the 90th percentile and the
2,that are the product of human action but
2,when you get to a point where you
2,invited to testify in front of congress and
2,live in two sorts of world at once
2,the program had some positive effectsbut in many
2,i think that the best way to think
2,the tax unit as the unit of analysis
2,going to look like you started the fight
2,and so on but at the same time
2,different and to take that dream which every
2,say it works even if you dont believe
2,want to see him be able to take
2,but i think its more than that i
2,to do in this book is to say
2,i want to live in a world where
2,that abridges the privileges or immunities of the
2,you are going to go back to the
2,our families to the macrocosmos our wider civilisation
2,and then i want to move on to
2,your life theres magic comingits the magic of
2,trying to do in this book is to
2,is this a good idea is this a
2,have a lot of interesting things to say
2,glut but some sectors are healthy only some
2,spent more time at the office and its
2,to get back up to the trend line
2,virgins get to talking the end is in
2,for today is a recent article you wrote
2,is led by a reasonably enlightened group of
2,i used to work in a cancer charity
2,of what jeffrey sachs does that i think
2,they just have different friends but they have
2,people set their hearts on fire saying im
2,who sit in the seat of adam smith
2,trying to steal a euro from an old
2,to take that dream which every human being
2,what are we going to do about that
2,live simultaneously within different kinds of orders according
2,be in prison or jail than are whites
2,in the fifth book of the wealth of
2,in many waysand you concede that the program
2,and i dont know what the answer is
2,little bit not a lot but a little
