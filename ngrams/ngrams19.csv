1,it was probably good timing russ when did you start andreessen horowitz the venture capital firm guest yeah so
1,and straightforward and can be represented by either being a color or a solid or gray but could just
1,where your keys are principle seems to be the extent to which you think about things deeply and carefully
1,there would be some shame and other costshumiliationthat might help it being enforced guest yeah its interesting in my
1,of evidence that says that the ifthen motivators often dont work very well and can sometimes backfire my contention
1,what they do and what they do istheres remarkably little difference when it comes to these types of core
1,enough theres no reason for them to run russ were solvent guest were solvent 1925 guest but now lets
1,of people made their own clothes here in this country we have progressively outsourced more and more tasks the
1,fairly welldeveloped stage i think a lot of the sort of creative side occurs well before your paper is
1,and screens it was actually never operational they never plugged it in but it became a symbol of this
1,help them make more profits over the long run drive down the average willingness to buy more cars back
1,friedman that it takes a couple of years till todays policy gets translated into inflation longer run focus results
1,seems really silly guests well whats silly is the idea that theres one thing called debt if we borrow
1,biology but by that i mean that economics is a very powerful way of helping us think about very
1,last 40 years we have the most tracked differences how rich families want their kids to be educated and
1,markets that margins werent being equated across markets thats pretty hard to accept because people are acting in all
1,full amount theyd give if they could collectivize guest i agree with you we do have a lot of
1,your response to that guest first of all i think during the recessionthey call the recession 2008 and 2009
1,never really went anywhere we spent a lot of time talking about what the standard should be and going
1,this in terms of economics is that because those peoples skills are different from people here already their skills
1,and regale them with stories as he apparently said everyone loves him but no one loves him so hes
1,heard all we ever meant with the efficient market hypothesis is that on average the markets are right never
1,more on the job but as you point out these impairments are not what we think of as disability
1,would probably do something similar probably invest in technology now i think that pepsi ones are better no doubt
1,pay cut lowering prices plays a role but lets disentangle demand for cars is down so prices of cars

1,the overall price level austrian theory is going to try to look at what actually happens money doesnt go
1,people now are entitled to reasons why policies that other people advocate make sense in our country not some
1,not thats absolutely right because you have so many people packed together in new york there are a lot
1,that there are two so i have two anchors the other person has none he comes up and he
1,that thats his view and i trust bob any of his other reasons for not running i think its
1,joneses can be unhealthy but i reject the argument that the median person is influenced by those rippling down
1,my own oversight what if you had someone like that instead of providing oversight of the bailout actually inside
1,up as problem what kind of problem is it some people think it is a character problemfailure to live
1,being honoredleading to financial chaos in the minds of the politicians and the regulators and so what do they
1,now help me with the science a genome sequence is say about 4000 right now theres something else thats
1,chanting immediately avoids halfhearted joiners groups have limited resources to check compliance 3359 what are the benefits these sacrificing
1,right theres a lot of mistakes being made not just the ones we are talking about guest yeah this
1,the unwillingness to accept new evidence is damning of ones position so the left the interventionists would look at
1,goes out of fashion and you may have a stylist who is really good at the old one one
1,a bad thing well i think if you love jazz then really if the jazz club even if its
1,to be making those decisions on a somewhat scientific basis it seems to me one of the arguments ive
1,how to remember their parents theres also twinadoption studies on this point this is a longlasting effect theres a
1,what im talking about is approximated by the regime we had under the classical gold standard where when the
1,incentives in the opposite direction creating excessive demand some insurers negotiate prices and use hmo clout to lower prices
1,reflected in the makeup of the state legislature second factor was wwi the brewers and wwi were not a
1,yet simple story many people have sort of written about it in your presentation you talked about the political
1,so you couldnt really do that neither you nor i i presume you are not a medical doctor russ
1,you are wrong it doesnt but it does change the culture of the profession the very first book i
1,something called prehypertension which is 120 over 80each time you change the definitions you increase the market you see
1,russ it is definitely a distraction its a form of consumption guest yeah i have no fetish for equipment
1,that its a game the key characteristic of venture capital is the returns are on a powerlog distribution so
1,a store would maybe lower its price but you are not in that same kind of market how does
1,and uncertainty and then lo and behold about a year ago i was riding down route 101 in a
1,in that language whereas in the past if you were a smithian economist you could speak in english french
1,so it decentralizes the decisions they are not made in washington but a total amount of money is clear
1,tough time i get audited by the irs i get a big tax bill i say what are some
1,no actually merton was incredible he had a great eye for stuff that would work and wouldnt work i
1,thats impossible it cantthat could never be the case and i would make the claim and i have i
1,part russ oh john come on you are going to tell me that just because they have a ba
1,party food and drinks comes from a third party you know you have to repay it and so the
1,welfare states they generally are ones that are ethnically homogeneous ones where people see themselves as being one identical
1,might have competing divisions i know there are retailers that their stores they have an inhouse arm that creates
1,making of that concept even mathematical concepts are in some sense openended in that way i dont think that
1,more than a gallery or museum the artifacts themselves are codependent on each other are intertwined and ecologically related
1,out of an assignment knight writing program at cornell in the 1980s assigned students to twice come up with
1,we bought our house we said well what would happen if we both lost our jobs and had to
1,now you have customers that use airports but their relationshipthe landlords so to speakis virtually nonexistent russ im just
1,people feel alienated is it important that we see precisely where our carrots come from is it saddening that
1,as much see this is the other thing i was talking about party sorting in 1970 the democratic electorate
1,print money true by definitionwhat the government owes is dollars and could create as many dollars as it needs
1,you are good for you in small doses so wine being an obvious example at least some people argue
1,get a lot more customers let me give you an example from another area that you mentioned earlier you
1,guest but you are right it does point to perhaps some systemic problems theres the famous work by john
1,raise their price because it would have been immoral for them to raise their price and he would say
1,right thing because if i try to sell it for more than 20 shillings a bushel they are going
1,we can see these losses in a world where when a bank suffers a loss everything is observable russ
1,did you end up in the united states guest well i was born in london i was born to

1,tiny portion of the electoratethe people who vote in the iowa caucuses or the new hampshire primary just are
1,all those athletic facilities and so forththis is consumption good theres no problem with a consumption good so long
1,you have really nothing on the other sideno politician wants to be viewed as soft on crime in environments
1,did it take that form what was the advantage to that worldi dont understand that its a piece missing

1,not for oversupplied unemployed resources but for very scarce resources phds and mds where the unemployment rate is close
1,keep it off that my attempts in the past to reduce intake to moderate my calorie consumption even if

1,before the regulators slapped on a multiplier didnt ask for more remote percentiles just take a safety factor safety
1,procedures the hospital would not provide those because the donor would object from the perspective of the indigent person
1,so much would have cascaded down a few months later they let lehman brothers fail which people have debated
1,that make you get by the sports writer who doesnt think very deeply about the problem and just thinks
1,what should be done about that fact we are talking about what should be the us policy toward people
1,they spend a lot more than they used to so to suggest that theres some crisis coming thats going
1,low number but applying it foolishly a mere 720 years from now my money will double that doesnt really
1,its just a simplification russ its tempting guest yes its tempting but wrong so i think as i said
1,incredibly surface descriptions the metrics of health russ yeah its naive too guest its very naive because what you
1,health care and in financial sector regulation you have animal spirits consumer confidence bouncing all around doing all kinds
1,era where there is no difference between fact and fiction or fiction and nonfiction fiction is really about truth

1,cant pay our debt i mean look at japan with a debttogdp ratio of over 200 we are nowhere
1,national level especially when its classified we can imagine the worst if there had been a series of violent
1,these noble impoverished folks who are to be revered because they rejected materiality and embraced spiritual lives and on
1,is what you see is what you get russ lets talk about this general issue in empirical work sometimes
1,i dont subscribe too much to the slow recovery because of financial crisis that makes me quite different from
1,we exchange our services we exchange sentiments and we do it from the moment of our birth to the

1,words necessary and proper when taken together mean appropriate and that clearly as a linguistic matter lowers the level
1,price difference with the transportation savings and they cant always do that it still raises the question given that

1,health care better health outcomes so we have all these drugs that reduce cholesterol but they dont its not
1,health care insurance from your employer the consumer price index cpi that you are using then to deflate your

1,fannie or freddie when they would talk about fannie and freddieand i say talkwhen they would have legislation about
