1,the ability to protest and freedom of speech that create a sort of early warning system which
1,will have to get out of the european union since you cant reerect borders if you are

1,this period19281932 france was doing all right because they didnt go through a serious deflation yet because
1,you dont talk much about the large private investment banks that issued private mortgagebacked securities mbs which
1,if so how could we head that way guestc okay ill take a first stab at it
1,make up the money supply in business theres another argument that says whats really important is the
1,rigorous about risk and there is a class of people who are trying to promote the idea
1,too but i think its different from our story because reciprocity is i do you a favor
1,the potential causes the complexity of this phenomena overweighs our ability to build terms to build interaction

1,this is basically the class size without giving you the number or answers let me just mention
1,degree sure our country is literally founded on distrust of government but pew does say that the
1,in the camp of thinking that the us government is not going to default either explicitly or
1,you have your progressive point of view im saying that its part of the process of how
1,essentially every trait on average but then the question is why does family resemblance exist most people
1,your risky assets you have to have 64 million not 6 million so you better go to
1,very downwardlybiased answer unreasonably pessimistic answer is reported by general public but when the crowd is misinformed
1,ask you a little more about the great depression youve written some very interesting things about that
1,it takes it assumes theres a distribution of power or income lets say that is not protected
1,and the possibility of intergroup violence those concerns might evolutionarily overpower the gains from trade but weve
1,found it very difficult to monetize didnt want to monetize the gold they got is there perhaps
1,culture and our society might evolve to deal with these issues so you said technology can either
1,more space to express themselves most people when asked would like to work less at jobs they
1,assumption is that that is only going to increase and improve and that assumption unfortunately may not
1,impartial spectator and theres an interesting question about whether that influenced kant or not they were contemporaries
1,are equals so what produced the difference this idea that the history of culture is all about
1,clockwork year after year and you heari read in the press once in a while that moores
1,we would do a sitcomor keynes would come back to life at this point we were in
1,make a distinction between psychic harm and physical harm so the example you gave for better or
1,college in america or too few most people would say too few because everybody should go to

1,evangelical religious message is definitely there but the core principles arent about religion 3034 general issue of
1,much more orientedit wasnt an a priori view of how you think about economics it wasnt a
1,it wants but the things were talking about these are contractual obligations between a state government and
1,dollars and they were able to cut that in half and it was very specifically designed with
1,old european money famous name didnt care about going publica few of them happy running business didnt
1,taxable unless you rolled it over after 1997 you could get the cash out distorted the choice
1,know the answer to that 2821 question 5 david williams to what extent did fannie mae and
1,out switzerland works very well that small mistakes are relatively harmless they just stay small they dont
1,world but what strikes me about listening to you which i think is quite spectacular is that
1,they come from all over the world last winter batch 7 out of 16 startups were from
1,of the politics but in terms of the fiscal health of this country russ thats really interesting
1,that is you change your promise thats the way nations deal with that i dont see the
1,macroeconomic events of the last 5 years have changed your view of economics or our profession if
1,sector really isnt enough to create a recession if you have stable monetary policy that keeps nominal
1,and thats simply because they cant get a signal of protection when they do these epidemiological studies
1,single human being who is harmed and who we can therefore empathize with and therefore sympathize with
1,a forced bankruptcy of bear and all the ripple effects possible but what would have been all
1,of lincoln emancipation martin luther kings father voted republican for example want to put lyndon b johnson
1,accept bitcoins till lots of people are using them and people dont want to use bitcoins until
1,to do 5 great papers a year expect some years of extraordinary productivity and other years of
1,but then they unplug you and you not only didnt actually accomplish the thing but you are
1,as if they are some sort of parameter of nature like a scientific model which they are
1,they were very concernedits hard to explain why sometimes you get a particular regulation in the united
1,pretty much the same amount of labor today as it took 50 years ago russ theres a
1,countries that adopt these policies do well then the puzzle is why dont they do that russ
1,only of the upper class but you are suggesting that thats going to come to an end
1,ahead and treat this in a very biologically based genomeguided way thats just one example i can
1,for instance having maybe somebody who understand economics from the labor movement or from nongovernmental organizations ngos
1,state and local level the total of federal spending has done anything close to go down over
1,pick up but is wreaking havoc on the machine and that right there that moment a human
1,thats exactly right russ alternatively you could said folks bad news were going to be attacked we
1,work in the large world and of course we have the invisible what i call logic of
1,that he allows a great deal of religious liberty and you can read his collected body of
1,russ it kind of ends the argument doesnt it guest yeah exactly and you wind up having
1,nicer the adjustments going to be the longer you take then in effect what happens is the
1,one reason people have been misled about the war is that they look at the data output
1,the bedside teaching that and its dinosaur stuff its all obsolete russ yeah well thank god sorry
1,or 5 guest well let me give you an example lets take 1000 and lets discount it
1,bankruptcy in the week before 350000 filed for bankruptcy under the old scheme then dropped from 2
1,he supported that in that same emergency session of congress that hoover called to deal with the
1,that joy did tell you to step aside but its parallel to the benevolent allegory story of
1,drive medium treasury rates down because we have a lot of theories out there that say those
1,mike took longer than most peoplewent to college and then got masters and phd why people go
1,preserver of plato and aristotle and all the rest of them the great plays and the rest
1,having paralegals actually practice law and certain services in the same way physicians assistants are we can
1,just hadnt got going the problems hadnt developed far enough 5702 russ lets close and talk about
1,you had to grow cotton that inefficiently youd be using up land that shouldnt be producing that
1,churchdissenters in prudence and conscience and they have this lovely way of talking back then so ill
1,think betsey saidwhen they see an axe they are going to grind it they just need to
1,the psychology of political beliefs including confirmation bias which is a very important one that i think
1,the kind of kurzweil thing doesnt make much sense if you look at it in detail on
1,dont deem that you are to be bailed out now of course its a gray area a
1,are wonderful that are outside that production boundary skype or russ econtalk guest or econtalk or these
1,have to live with so we lets not forget about those but lets bring in something that
1,at a very low rate within a bank there is a reserve requirementa minimum amount of capital
1,which is swap a set of students who are subject to one method for the method that
1,30 40 years ago decried but is it true there has been a sorting process goldwater vs
1,of libertarian paternalismnudging people or straight out coercing them rely on timeinconsistency notion that what feels good
1,80 million russ 500 million guest its hard to feel sorry for them people do point them
1,romney has said nothing i think thats pretty smart of him actually michelle bachmann has said she
1,such institutions that 010236 rs thats a huge qualification richard 010238 re no no no no no
1,are you with your life on a scale of 0 to 10 and what we see is
1,are being used guest the project in general is exploring many many innovative delivery mechanisms once we
1,we can attribute to general material wellbeing in particular nutrition just having more to eat when we
1,by it we are to some extentnot me and you but academic economistshave been the cheerleaders for
1,the knowledge of others in advance next question is why didnt they have to resign why not
1,for plane flights the biggest merchant so far to accept bitcoin is probably overstockcom which sells all
1,markets like that air travel to small markets public broadcasting telecommunications in small markets do we abolish
1,in the economy then we should be able to do much better than average they actually did
1,air well go into much more technical detail later on why that actually works so one of
1,know whether at this point ecologists are actually making quantitative predictions and seeing them borne out but
1,of heating to be realized in the atmosphere so theres a lag in the system associated with
1,lose face because of shunning and loss of social status if its known that im a deadbeat
1,chinese numbers is that when you have massive migration from a rural area to the cities your
1,what did you do before this guest so i spent 8 years as an assistant us attorney
1,claim what i noted about it is those are all factors where any change would be resisted
1,wouldnt be enough in bank to cover its debt if buy them at 60 transparent subsidy to
1,all imperfectly informed we all find lots of ways guest well you know you like this shirt
1,wait a seconddoes everyone pay back their loans no theres like a 3 default rate wait a
1,you want just to say thats the case then i dont think you need to do any
1,debt by identity russ right but thats one way in which a nation can consume more than
1,he was referring to the longer period 19822000 central banker system getting more complex rising after 1995
1,net neutrality no net neutrality is higher up in the stack net neutrality is stacks on top
1,a third choice which is why dont we spend our time and energy dealing with what the
1,me tell you come with me thats more exciting than here it is great example digressing for
1,by voting are going to turn the united states into the kind of country they got away
1,on it you argue that his methodological view helped advance his ideological position explain what you mean
1,up with and you can see you cross the border and you suddenly enter into a very
1,russ they also would have presumed there would be mass starvation if only 1 guest exactly right
1,understand which ones have survived 4647 the word markets can mean many things farmers market ny stock
1,but thats not the right description or set of conditions that we are looking at we are
1,were going to have a middle class life having a poetry degree from a secondtier school today
1,security called the uncovered sector but you also asked the employer we asked the employer what the
1,dead even if they look alive 635 fascinating about both books is that you force the reader
1,and the reason now turning to the locke reading which almost no one knows about thisits a
1,income basically 1512 i want to come back to this parallel between our subprime crisis and the
1,its not true you look for a counterexample if it tells you its true you look for
1,still possible and thats why ecology is increasingly powerful a science and we can make some predictions
1,that was howyou can derive the power of fat tails with some counterfactuals but what is essential
1,that parity because the english money stock and price level were much higher when it restored the
1,probably right russ not that theres anything wrong with a farmers market i like them myself guest
1,what a country stands for and so even though this is in a truncation of freedom of
1,nothing better than to have sophisticated users dangerous to build a product for giant corporations want to
1,given the kind of life situation you might be inyou dont take your meds every week or
1,that government can do to make a politician look good second point some people get very upset
1,like to see the federal reserve get less involved in the systemic risk but i know thats
1,were doing it all again as if we completely forgot so theres something else going on here
1,column people who take risks for the sake of others it cant function that way it cannot
1,they hadnt been able to do give out money while there was opposition not much in the
1,argue we have to spread the burden because we are all getting the benefits of this security
1,sort of the same thingwhen you have a real exchange rate depreciation thats tantamount to a decrease
1,on growth but small guest a positive correlation that we think is most plausibly interpreted as an
1,allows stalin later to brand him as antiparty everyone knew stalin was bugging everybody but still stupidly
1,about it 5238 russ let me give you a different perspective and well close with this because
1,relates to what we said about proxies earlier in the conversation and i would like to tell
1,remarkable that in a time when nominal spending measured in actual dollars not corrected for inflation has
1,but some are better face to face and some are better if there is more than one
1,or an accountant they can do all this stuff online but the magic of a really productive
1,should be that what we have is more fat tails because the process that generates the new
1,obama winsat which hell win the democratic vote and the republican voteand that will be on the
1,money who is going to pay a price for that where would the political costs of that
1,leave by then he was fated as a soviet hero everyone knew mercader had killed trotsky on
1,live there and left wants to work there ozzie and harriet versus old bigbusinessbig governmentbig labor triumvirate
1,that ability of unions to unionize the service jobs that have grown is small productivity changes is
1,the fault of the united states of america what is the short answer to that guestc no
1,of course people bought it without the rating illustrated that this is a weird not normal competitive
1,the incentive structure on the regulatory side and the third thing we have to do is stop
1,challenge of imagining how you will feel in the future its a rational expectations condition its voluntary
1,and i have a good time series on what the black market rate is actually they have
1,living on it every since ive sort of given up the habit of thinking about the permanence
1,we make this point in the book usually depositors know which banks were healthy or not but
1,meet our mortgage payments fortunately i was steadily employed throughout that time but if we hadnt been
1,will buy the securities the banks have lots of reserves with which to buy longerterm securities i
1,curve where your store looks too cluttered and all of a sudden consumers are like i dont
1,economy inside your own head take the cultural stream of russ roberts economics maybe some baseball go
1,bush for a while its because you need them you need to transport food about the fifth
1,then family will think i dont care about them limited options do we really want our children
1,broswhen that failed thats when things got bad should have bailed them out too lehman brothers if
1,going on there besides actual literal cooperation between two individuals and accuse you of just making up
1,thing guest so america has the most generous bankruptcy system in the world which is something a
1,so the more successful you were in creating these models which gave you discursive power and academic
1,not like that there still was an expectation that these firms had a social function after privatization
1,it came to all these national security kinds of issues so i mean i do think you
1,would not have produced even senators and other folks in his party well well see what happens
1,through your body they end up in your small intestine a few weeks later russ i think
1,you are going to have to think about it yourself guest yeah and certainly not all i
1,do that often i have to say im somewhat skeptical to me the bewley story indicates some
1,do things on their own the idea of these megaprojects goes out the window because its not
1,company to lend out lack of market discipline creditors expectationsas long as they are what they are
1,can have as much influence on the us economy or society as the us education system because
1,havent read it its the parallel explanation for when you put forward a hypothesis and people say
1,the problem isnt so much the drugs themselves but the context in which they are used and
1,is guest probably the african pygmy actually ed begley consumes a lot more fossil fuel and energy
1,machine philosophic construct if you could give up your current life and plug into this machine and
1,and the government then got into agricultural assistance social welfare retirement planning the economy social security work
1,person need to workto earn one but now a lot of tvs today some of them are
1,fewer of these big busts more politically likely we need to do more to constrain bubbleseg restricting
1,most important thing is to make this into a reality in a particular place people can imagine
1,expense with great honor and he says thats the happiest life a person could live russ and
1,banking crisis which are extreme risky assets that banks are holding and tolerance for extreme leverage of
1,his enthusiasm and sometimes rahrahism would come powering motoring into a village in his convoy of un
1,be government officials who are sort of waiting to be able to do something and then this
1,those are laws they dont come out from the bottom up they are not the result of
1,much higher guest much higher in the united states russ as is automobile accidents per capita you
1,just common sense late 1960s early 1970s inflation got into double digits fed would put on the
1,of these classesyou can teach yourself many of these things without going to university whats true is
1,that people could get through tollbooths faster wouldnt it be great if we could use the same
1,well no maybe the balance before wasnt proper or maybe there were good reasons to rebalance even
1,saidmaybe its a good segue to the macrothat is a little bit different from others we had
1,been seen that way but for whatever reason it was at the time and then the other
1,whether its unions or oldfashioned welfare states contributory social insurance to a new economy in which much
1,theres a lot of deregulation others would say theres a lot more intervention a lot more government
1,so they are becoming more spherical russ its awesome its like the earth the earths not really
1,government facilitating vs retarding free flow of goods like ice four young entrepreneurs from goldsboro nc saved
1,well do a better job than i could of summarizing that and the unconstrained vision just says
1,years of experience than men of the same age because of childbirth newton wasnt the first man
1,need to meet and engage them and on sort of two sides of the discussion one is
1,home environment there are a thousand things but the unwillingness to embrace change in the face of
1,they should have stopped that i think is at least part of the reason that we bailed
1,everybodys working in the manor selfsufficient once you get globalization or a national market with specialization then
1,as these working class school districts start to look like very poor school districts did that those
1,know anything about that guest yeah i think the best evidence about that gets back to the
1,harmful and for a long time it was i mean read charles dickens russ sewage running in
1,ask myself why did they have a leverage ratio of 33 to 1 i dont think it
1,is in the early part of the 20th century detroit was something like silicon valley a hub
1,deal with is to deal with unexpected large things and im adding the word unexpected which you
1,me i hope for them as well but one of the students in the class told me
1,you watch countries turkey going through this right now where they are something happens politically and they
1,thing was like russ youre talking about the supreme court decision guest the supreme court decision they
1,should a scrubber be required cars should we require a particular car it often sounds like the
1,when you are making a market all we are talking about having to do with glass steagall
1,what makes this more is that when fixed costs are big we dont expect markets to do
1,never really appealed to them russ it probably varies by kids guest i think it does russ
1,one of the reasons i cant bear to read my booksi cant actually read the text of
1,fannie and freddie have always been around community reinvestment act cra has always been around therefore those
1,rogue nurses killed peoplethey injected excess amounts of insulin into them what happens is they get brain
1,had added tagging automatically got this aggregate view cost of doing this institutionally would have included advertising
1,its a positive thing for kids to say were not going to get in the habit of
1,absolutely yes and i dont really care about the costbenefit analysis because im worried about these income
1,decision that was made by geithner when he was still president of the ny fed to pay
1,so what my argument is about is that these places that are voting you know 85 90
1,or whatever although i would argue that the public school system does a bad job of treating
1,that you took this mooc when do employers start looking at mooc certificates or groups of mooc
1,of telling him to ease up it was just the opposite if not now when would be
1,its collapse so thats what i would say is one of the potential signs of a problem
1,the game starts 13 mile from game a lot of venues price their tickets such that its
1,look at net exports in open economy if one of those goes down such as c beginnings
1,churn goes on in this economy its through the work of haltiwanger and his coauthors getting the
1,doing what he did he had said were not going to let nominal gdp fall were going
1,was a good editor very very good organizer downside is that he was vain he was exceptionally
1,to compete for deposits leading to ted spread bernanke and paulson put together the tarp plan and
1,seems to me to be sort of an unstable and unfortunate combination russ i agree although you
1,say or the patriarch or matriarch who kept kids in line guest absolutely so the whole idea
1,people and so thereby they miss the main solution to how development does happen which is free
1,us government put in a 50 billion loan guarantee rescuing not mexico though thats what it was
1,said in fact it was just about slavery that was my genuine serious departure from my youthful
1,chrysler deal was a provision that gives chrysler a very big incentive to roll out a green
1,talked a bit from a blog post that i did pittsburg pitcher gives up a home run
1,have to figure it out it usually just happens 5424 russ now you mentioned before we started
1,have none of this peru had a free press on the surface government set about corrupting the
1,got started it went awfully fast im just thinking back to 1776 and then we had the
1,festival activities and so on but obviously not anything like people of the wealth of croesus russ
1,allow judges to go on a casebycase basis and lower the principal for homeowners 3 the senate
1,right but a lot of them are just like you they have a viewpoint and theyve crammed
1,block which had stuck on the gold standard for the longest period left in 1936 eichengreen and
1,become an expert on who is reliable and who is likely to pay me back the bank
1,be smaller and it would be much more difficult for executives in banks to make as much
1,history of the world is maybe small average differences in inclination between men and women gradually get
1,has the horror of being relatively unnoticed so it does tend to lead to revenue creep in
1,and i think without a term without a banner to rally under it hampered them and i
1,do you think the students got out of it compared to the students that didnt get the
1,just best that everybody sets aside their differences agrees to disagree and then goes about their daily
1,depending civil society and it encouragespart of it is just a matter of taste and expertisebut it
1,of england whats the worst case scenario stress test haldane was struck by how small the stresses
1,les mis les miserables its 2 hours and 40 minutes long nobody left i dont think anybody
1,crisis the inflation question becomes more pressing in a 510 year time horizonnot 5 years from now
1,theres a transaction going onruss on the subject you mentioned earlier contrasts between what might be called
1,sell the drugs what is it they actually do we dont know very few people have done
1,bitcoin correct guest thats true i dont really know although you know given the communication and given
1,more than saudi arabia having natural resources isnt just neutral but bad for you nigeria big prize
1,and i think that people like amos tversky or daniel kahneman were like artists for me namely
1,the united states compared to other countries including those in western europe where in the united states
1,products out and if you build a road that is accessible most of the year by normal
1,got two things going on one labor is physically more productive in making capital goods but the
1,work now there are probably people who get satisfaction from it i dont want to suggest that
1,to find more of it and as prices go up people find more ways to do without
1,general because part of the fun of being a fan of sports is that you dont just
1,nothing bad has happened to themhavent been laid off simply cant behave normally something clinically wrong with
1,traditional classroom with 100 studentsdont you think that has some real potential guest i think it does
1,originally behind it have started to have second thoughts people who depend on corn have had to
1,religion did away with the ban later on made it easier under judaism interest to a fellow
1,taxes but the people who dont file taxes so they have to make some assumptions about who
1,short run issue andy why dont you go first mcafee yeah there are probably too many too
1,betteri think our presumption is that that sounds to them as it sounds to us one core
1,duopolists that are out there have tended to do which is offer something freely with very little
1,of population growth and its relationship to resources which i think is not the most helpful way
1,to not recognize that seems silly to me although i think in fact like done correctly it
1,as you say we look across all the different margins guest but i will take this a
1,one of the appendices of the us census bureau documents appendix c russ good to know guest
1,against socialism claiming that socialism will have to do without economic calculation which means that socialism will
1,make sure they were teaching them the right things and like that and with regard to religious
1,me you listen to them 4 and 5 times thats one way to get more out of
1,forest service will knock down anything if it wants to build a road and wont necessarily take
1,i call in my new book the prescriptive constitutionie if somebody trespasses on your land hes a
1,challenge i never thought about the challenge being the realizing of the expectations or the uncertainty about
1,dont know if its significant that there are these parallels but its interesting guest yes i think
1,it was before interest rate in this country has to be the same as it is in
1,disappointing ranging from people being unwilling to share datawhich is not true of reinhart and rogoffto results
1,that that was a bad choice most car buyers unlike most voters spend a lot of time
1,about this explosion and the reasons for this explosion in labor market activity post1981 1982 recession i
1,could afford a small portion of a book so novelists like dickens published their books in monthly
1,we are talking about including pay to soldiers and a bunch of other stuff pay to soldiers
1,whats appropriate to get involved with money to deworm the kids but community suspect or may not
1,excited about a particular asset classin this case it was housing and as those prices start to
1,say look lets reduce the number of human beings who are participating in this economy and thats
1,seriously so what these models do is the same thing that they used to do they are
1,a student standard deviation 100 points so just think of them as being 100 points behind on
1,irrational that kind of manichean choice is artificial there are lots of other counterweights out there apart
1,confront over the next generation i believe we found a wonderful quote from voltaire that ill end
1,next year we are doing x y and z and its not as much fun as it
1,the city our apartment someone said was decorated like a yachtyou had to sort of everything was
1,superstar one of the five greatest hockey players of all time guest and was a great passer
1,on the interest rates they could pay to depositors couldnt operate across state lines in the 1970s
1,powerful and beautiful gilgamesh was a hero for going into the forest and cutting the trees down
1,who are good at high school math its hard to know when you look at these studies
1,ipads iphones making real money on the hardware all the apps make money on the apps as
1,speculate on that and then where could it go what directions might it be heading youre absolutely
1,so the original version was you states can do all kinds of things but weve got this
1,what sustained him actually as long as he was successful was the unrealized expectation that he would
1,do this with google maps and google maps by the way is a miraculous program in many
1,you should read this book written by a journalist compelling evidence that god exists i said i
1,and the autocrats that are running development from the top down and that is neither morally desirable
1,past 50 years and i hope well still get improvements in cardiovascular disease too but the cancer
1,is guest the persians would have pronounced it entirely differently russ okay i thought maybe i would
1,that guest there are different levels of reaction so one piece of reaction that i expected was
1,who talked about the power of writing as a way of learning to stay about future initiatives
1,yeah another way to say it is that the risk falls on the taxpayer rather than on
1,for having done good live values consistently selfesteem selfmotivationwork is more than work sense of purpose that
1,just that they dont understand it because they seem to understand it better in other walks of
1,much so in the case of landuse regulation the land use regulation starts off in the 19th
1,if the state raises taxes not for revenue purposesthats what i want to put to the sidebut
1,honor its commitments to its creditors describe what the fed did creatively over that weekend weve talked
1,the classical economics tradition whatever your political or ideological or methodological take is i think it is
1,after and really during the whole time period while they are pitching this to congress they realize
1,we are going to make we are realistic in saying people have been trying forever to improve
1,dollar zimbabwe note that one of my students sent meyou are saying thats worthless now im very
1,to tell us what to do or around a hospital or whatever around a school all of
1,in a handful of key industries and they do favors for each other the government protects the
1,be more aggressive you have some other plans some fiscal policy or other things you think would
1,more effectively take an example you mention in the book a number of times you argue in
1,to look at unique events economists like to look at models and regularities to some extent the
1,50 million of it came from george soros russ is that a lot of money 120 million
1,any of these without the other they are simultaneous interactive wealth is created hard to explain to
1,difference between mimicking and imitating can you think of a time when you mimicked would a tyrant
1,we can tell in those socalled typical recessions guest right so the 1970s recession the 198182 recession
1,fortune cookie factory which manages to crank out 10000 fortune cookies a day with exactly two workers
1,there are different periods of american history where government is relatively small but starting aroundyou could say
1,behind a veil of ignorance i dont know if im going to be one of the gifted
1,cities and they answered no no were trying to keep animals away from the recycle bins hmmm
1,all in the stock market and lost it all and became not quite penniless but yale university
1,the pound sterling thats a very rapid changing of the guard and it reflected two thingsthe creation
1,how much is social libertarian freedom versus economic freedom more social bryan caplans documentation most americans are
1,at all levels city county state federal is about 30 most of the developed western countries in
1,to prove how smart you were ive certainly gotten a lot less sanguine about economic modeling in
1,swapping assets around right so that is a little bit of a puzzle i have to admit
1,there yet nobodys articulating that strategy part of the resolution will be tax increases negative for the
1,is feedback not the absence of waste in private markets because clearly markets do waste things not
1,doctors are motivated only by the desire to help people if they can cultivate that reputation theyll
1,is an economist and i occasionally was afraid he would be too much like an economist like
1,that for some obese individuals some types of diabetics 0 carbs may be necessary to restore them
1,russ congratulations guest and the human biology its just not capable of tracking an object moving that
1,insurance contract so you wont suffer any default losses might do that trading strategy had to sell
1,given rise to the idea that there are cells in the brain that are involved in rehearsing
1,even when they were undoubtedly getting calls from the white house chewing them out for being supportive
1,what we can do is learn and democracies do actually learn even very populist democracies so weve
1,of the standard explanations for why thats happened so why is college more productive for people who
1,higher probability of staying in office how many were there of that group roughly how many democrats
1,workshops didnt work because people didnt practice we get into practice so you practice it you make
1,the only thing im paying for is either you got into the school which is a filter
1,to does not assume that individuals are motivated solely by selfishness or gain it is a method
1,you have to save money so that you can go to college when you are older so
1,along and said wait youve got the same decreases in heart disease rates all over finland in
1,actually is true guest yeah so whats pretty striking is we have evidence from the panel study
1,spend 700 billion dollars because the world was coming to an endhe saidany minute it didnt congress
1,parity as the dominant element and they assume that if you were a big guy and you
1,separate it from effect of wwi us does have a major recession with a bottom in 1921
1,the way you want and changing them the opposite total failurenot like youd see a little bit
1,were not going to spend this much money russ of course you know the standard criticism of
1,for defense of the ancients various games and of course there is portal which is aesthetically very
1,part of what we found out during this financial crisis is that a lot of debts that
1,net that out to talk about the net debt to the public which is a little bit
1,financial reform would you want to add a health care reform which is going to create huge
1,would easily make them solvent for the foreseeable futureare you against that or in favor of it
1,here is that any of these differences are on average obviously there are women capable and interested
1,now youve got me going so think about modern chemistry modern chemistry has been an incredible source
1,set the land law up on end 554 must be variety across different states variation across states
1,lets move on to some general questions about education that these issue inevitably trigger your thinking about
1,fats come from carbs making us sicker and charging us for their services multicollinearitysome things go together
1,and consumption to increase whats happened in the us is that our economy has slowedstill growing but
1,imperfect and that aggregation should only take place when its absolutely necessary or a strong improvement because
1,burned beer cheap at the time now guinness commands a premium we have competitors out there that
1,suggesting the other way of course is to sell assets correct yes you could do that and
1,structure with literally hundreds of independent states each with their own independent governments so the question we
1,for our econ stories keynes hayek rap video auxiliary material robert said something quite profound he said
1,said guest thats not what he said russ as always guest but he showed that in the
1,do have at valve because lets face ityou do something ship it you see immediately the quantities
1,decline weve seen very recently is not just a consequence of the recent recession but really this
1,physical harm thats measurable we might not be able to measure the size of the harm but
1,he talks about the question of whether wwii cured the great depression and he says wow one
1,rubbed shoulders with a lot of different sets of people want to compare them politicians and athletes
1,of being greedy ceos appear to be the ones who stand in the way of people who
1,you into the quarter pile and somebody else got a c which put him into the nickel
1,a lot of fundamentalsbased innovation a lot of new ideas new businesses wanting to hire new workers
1,one instrumentone leverand with one instrument you can at most pursue one independent objective congress tells the
1,point to any one thinker or president or dictator as responsible something is changing about the relative
1,one is that as you point out not only does it dilute the existing shareholderswhich the executives
1,breakthroughs of technology especially information technology which makes it possible to organize efforts that were beyond organizational
1,costs more money to get the hip replacement surgery but on the other hand the indirect costs
1,try really hard to frame that to minimize it russ by the way through the magic of
1,about new york city or washington dc 842 so the government looked at this bus system and
1,business and where the revenue comes from because ultimately if the revenue is there my clients will
1,think thats whats going on i listened to the great podcast with doug by the way i
1,luck as you point out in the paper you say things like based on the information i
1,independents are close to that as well and then the minority are republicans if you look at
1,classroom model russ explain what that is guest so thats a model where instead of lecturing in
1,arm of what people are doing to the earth now is much smaller than what has happened
1,that often the suppliers of various parts where the chains of ideas moving across people and of
1,made famous basically its a synthetic version of a hormone in the body that cues your body
1,dont do surveys generally were stuck with it you know in macrotheres only so many countries and
1,income inequality increased between 1992 and 1993 it didnt it just was in our ability to capture
1,the supreme court case of bobby and the wabash railroad sort of indicated that you know states
1,you systematically process most of the long run evidence and the modern experience the evidence on the
1,read richard dawkinss book its going to convince you that you are wrong im an atheist i
1,to go strangle his victims with his hands but he is only one of a small group
1,i dont think we can ever do better than this is that robert skidelsky who is keyness
1,stay at home rather than coming here so the microsofts and the googles in this world will
1,could let people who are on medicare who by definition almostthey arent all retired but most of
1,britannica as a source is unacceptable not the right role for a research project instead should be
1,capital so long as they do it wisely when they do it poorly why should i have
1,roepke just tosses them out of his house and once hes shut the door behind him he
1,the subsidies of the developed world farmers in undeveloped countries poor countries have trouble competing and that
1,we dont know how to estimate them critique of the models was basically that they relied a
1,our power system be largely automated in our organizations in our tasks in our jobs for a
1,weve gone to lower and lower trend rates of inflation think that this one is the same
1,different than life today in virtually every dimension so this is a pleasant in many ways scenario
1,is still racial inequality in incarceration and there is still educational inequality and one of the key
1,public transport timeshift when they drive right now the evidence suggests it is very hard to persuade
1,were preventing him from getting the product to market but realized that these patents had created the
1,data to the roper center archive people doing the polls would not accuse them of dishonesty its
1,same julian simon i think would say it is the same but india china are much more
1,fellowfeeling of the butcher and baker and brewer that we look for our sustenance its to their
1,base to go on to do a second act there are always times when we underprojected or
1,some sort of mechanistic relationship i am just arguing that there is a lot less competition between
1,not in compliance with fannie and freddies regulations fannie and freddie would not be on the hook
1,valuable people who could acquire information from others must have had some survival advantages if you are
1,proposal asks both sides to come together and abandon partisan advantage and just agree that we will
1,about 40 out of 100000 live births were triplets by 1998 that number had reached almost 200
1,early on an outspoken critic of some of the bush administrations activities in the war and i
1,can make projections about how many more deaths there might be on average as a result of
1,stearns point i absolutely believe that they thought they were doing the right thing i dont have
1,figuring out what they could have done differently i dont think it would happen i think kids
1,international mantra and the herd followed and thats where the basel thing accelerated and got going and
1,not necessary and when its the doctor as a patient they are better able to push back
1,so forth that wasnt addressed by phelpss work in the 1960s was just addressing the prevailing view
1,im going to effectively translate these papers and present them in a very interesting way and i
1,more time because leisure is much more widespread both at the sort of very young and old
1,analogy ship that couldnt sink because if leak damage would be limited to one area no way
1,stop but it almost completely stops and this is viewable by objective measures by magnetic resonance imaging
1,they are not going to decide their votes so obama can say im not going to worry
1,a small sector have such a destructive effect why didnt bear stearns and merrill lynch just have
1,or august 5th or whatever where the government cant cover all of its obligations you are suggesting
1,two bottlenecks on the rail corridor going up the northeast those are well documented if youll go
1,be very highly subsidized our air service tends to be much better far more competitive i mean
1,from monetary system market system first sees that people are not going out to eat that often
1,4114 russ so ive mentioned ed leamer before hes been a pioneer in trying to get economists
1,who are going to be owed these promisesthat is the baby boomers which would be me among
1,the economy in zimbabwe it was doing very very poorly you could probably call it a recession
1,are things other than just the cost of the labor and materials guest yes very much so
1,the same time acknowledging fully that we dont actually have a window on it and as you
1,that in a sense was liberating and allowed him to play with booze in a whole different
1,countries which were really remarkable in terms of turning around around almost similar periods one was gorbachevs
1,recovering from a collapsed housing bubble and we arent at least prepared at this point to do
1,much weve learnedi guess i see two different stories here one is are they doing the right
1,because the causethe rent controlsis government mandated health care lipstein podcast why did bear stearns engage in
1,didnt know about you can be wowed and amazed through the visual arts in ways that were
1,about their travels so in the end they ended up very amiable and always through hayek as
1,education so its not that it is somehow russ only a trillion guest yes and a fair
1,some of those savings are going to be offset and there are a lot of things that
1,dealing with the fact that there was indeed rationing there was very severe rationing on durable goods
1,what he saw as a vision of understanding the world and he never paidit seemed to me
1,took their chances paid their money they were bad bets they lost not meor not us but
1,our big issues here is communicating with some reliability what we will do down the road and
1,currencies would do nothing in response and 2 as if prices wouldnt adjust to offset the socalled
1,think the problem with that claim is that proportional representation contains such a wide variety of different
1,figure out who is impeding that action for political or other disingenuous reasons and tackle themdo whatever
1,own little firms and trying to eke out a living by selling what they can sell or
1,others but still the naughty corner does work you just have to be consistent about it if
1,that the only possibility for me having the kind of success that i wanted is taking some
1,there would be a clear distinction between the two types of firms but some of the firms
1,7 months and agreed they would turn it off and then held a referendum about whether to
1,minutes if somebody tried to do that then everybody else would check their bitcoins and see that
1,papers in fact eberling with liberty fund has brought out the selected works along with the collected
1,then id be interested in what do you think would be the interesting issues in science in
1,we likethe way they look the way they feel we touch them sometimes we are sampling themthey
1,the most influential public intellectual during his lifetime by an enormous amount he had the ear of
1,on industrial accidents this is a literature that economists have nothing to say about its dominated by
1,inflation in the energy sector this year thats quite confusing and nonsensical talk if what is meant
1,done which was to understand that you have to understand the limitations of an ordinary libertarian theory
1,suppose we build a new research lab and hire an administrative person who was previously employed in
1,process has to be ongoing work authorities have to be prepared to intervene how do you keep
1,your book based on that and id love to get your reaction right before i read your
1,and if you put something in the water the more you use up the higher will be
1,dead simple but will take a month for your brain to adjust to the new diet during
1,the money supplynot always but usually the money supply the question i want to ask is the
1,enormous they would be destroyed so i dont actually worry about default because if congress doesnt work
1,in and they throw the body down in front of youyou dont have time to get scientific
1,the part i never understood about thatand this i think feeds into your breaking down the discount
1,a trench putting an actual duct pulling a fiber through that duct making a hole in the
1,is a record which one is going to do more for your career almost everyone says well
1,inflation expectations target the gap between an indexed bond and a conventional bond gap between those two
1,you go from hunting to farming demand for fish is going up healthy great source of protein
1,rules and form example industrial organization io or macro literature people using published prices as the measure
1,good he applauds and admires himself sacrifice life in battle knowledge problem cant know everyones moral worth
1,ignoredin one direction which is the direction of its supposed to restrain government its not been very
1,as you just said but the incentives are just awful and you are talking about the traders
1,in more energy than the body expends 3300 russ so thats one way to think about it
1,the united states in a substandard or inferior quality are really the measures that weve talked about
1,long time and its a worry ive learned from gary sterns work is well thats true that
1,some of the great achievements are its actually through more judicial intervention rather than less let me
1,unless steve jobs had had enough autonomy to make that decision partly in search of profits he
1,losses for the creditors of bear stearns would probably have been a good idea not saying that
1,priceas it was producing before russ so that can either happen by expansion or byit happens by
