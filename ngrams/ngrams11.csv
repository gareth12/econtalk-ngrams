1,years ago thats because they are not spending it then you
1,if this kind of weaponry makes the state completely invulnerable so
1,long and productive livesbuchanan was still writing papers i saw him
1,this out on the fly with all the political pressures on
1,an increase in the centralization of power in the private economic
1,job offer i teach at nyualways call back he had an
1,but if you just focus on pocketbook issues of the food
1,for a reason i understand the libertarian objectionthat were for markets
1,hope would beor theyor i would advise them would be a
1,people could use their creativity in extraordinarily exuberant and satisfying ways
1,list and why thats bad so start with what are the
1,no other way for the economy to develop if you rely
1,this is a case where the economic advisers were not enthusiastic
1,the loans of the senior creditors how can bank every do
1,to be a utopian not to try and envisage how the
1,quickly grow obese and effectively what he was doing was removing
1,innovation somebody introduces it and does really well then others begin
1,strengths but we are losing some of that magic because of
1,presidential level in some way you have to but i think
1,a direct replication shame on them so these areyou know we
1,there guest they produce less certainly a colony thats moved around
1,of their name have copyright protection of all the twodimensional designs
1,party has control of which branch but is it important is
1,talking about this which is the following if its true that
1,the other 5631 russ we focused the whole time on monetary
1,cycle weve had since 1982 weve gone to lower and lower
1,many economists there 5611 russ i want to close by asking
1,have an accident in an old car and you bring it
1,very lucky goes in 1736 and glasgow university had just been
1,gone through wwii we know what we are talking aboutthat you
1,that fever gates keeps fires burning perhaps by worrying if company
1,event of a similar magnitude of the three most dramatic events
1,wasnt competition to see who could patent the next prostate cancer
1,wouldnt these regimes still want to encourage some kinds of economic
1,thing general morale difficulty of persisting in these investigations not to
1,and this has to do with nutrition and malnutrition but malnutritionthe
1,they have to only show balanced articles or a balance of
1,to be falling the forests were going to be killed the
1,they were bear stearns and lehman but it would include goldman
1,a lot of changes still true in a lot of urban
1,6 years ill hit 65but transfers between working people and old
1,model of lack of transparency ridiculous prices and so forth in
1,to political pressure obsessed with creating a riskfree world extremely complex
1,a quote of about 3 words from a movie publisher princeton
1,its about 10 of the overall labor market the vast majority
1,an independent expert group that is overseeing the evaluation we are
1,away 120 million dollars it doesnt matter how many billions you
1,adam smith believed that capitalism made us better people i dont
1,then maybe what you want to do is start over russ
1,do what they often do which is when they get in
1,time but i think there is some truth to the idea
1,like a referee or an umpire they are calling the balls
1,dont want to wait for monetary policy to trickle down and
1,cbo under their protocols for scoring can sometimes double count things
1,lead to a conflict between the stable price level and the
1,my view is how do you then rein in the frankensteins
1,think so i think there is very good reason to believe
1,of capital goods is the way it was in his model
1,that health care spending keeps rising and will continue to risethats
1,is not allowed to run that experiment so thats why economists
1,hostile but i think as people look at it its kind
1,most peopletheres a lot of problems with our political systembut i
1,then in the 1980s hayek was on the rise because reagan
1,by cowen a listener asked what are the limits of libertarianism
1,and zvi had been a chicago phd and a chicago professor
1,which i think by the way is a quote from pauline
1,people are thinking that the sheriffs going to be knocking on
1,conforming loans for typical americans it wasnt for people at the
1,traffic light systemred is getting worse green is getting better and
1,a few months after the tal afar campaign started when mcmaster
1,new branch of agriculture will spring up to provide the feedstock
1,person actually could write a test even though they might want
1,taxes and all indirect taxes property taxes if renting someone is
1,prohibition enforcement law voted to be repealed overwhelmingly the only people
1,though some of them have been investing in their own business
1,same as cash income for tax purposes we always look to
1,time of having children is quite substantial russ yeah i dont
1,guest once we had had that particular analysis strategy those covariates
1,engineers or development workers from the west who never fully understand
1,do with it because of technology and the internet and television
1,accounting and industrial law and so on or a commerce degree
1,in these studies you can see it in newspaper articles we
1,argued that it did not make sense to analyze the effect
1,a polygamous society because there will be such a surplus of
1,but certainly the way we have things set up now it
1,people who are strangers somewhere out in cyberspace actually become much
1,up enough the other obvious variables are unemployment and inflation people
1,distribution the 90th percentile and also the middle thats also increasing
1,this is an effect of actual treatment and the application of
1,disseminated wine to other congregations alameda california names of people who
1,want to go into basketball or baseball or football and so
1,wiped out the problem we are dealing with now is that
1,startup and each is usually very committed to the value of
1,email never want to come down who enjoy the fact that
1,the rules of the game the other part of governmentthe welfare
1,you lecture them relentlessly as i do about the virtues of
1,as being right jensens inequality an average of expectations is not
1,and this has happened to some extent political liberty is remains
1,question to what we were just talking about before thatthe government
1,that is not important does government involvement make it work better
1,contingent valuations in environment and now in health care very important
1,recommend because its been shown to workwhich is basically nothing at
1,billion in restricted stock what do you pay on that in
1,had been for a given level of reserves prior to wwi
1,closing minutes about iran because its an example of hyperinflation and
1,moral imperative in the united states at least over the last
1,everincreasing amount of gdp has failed to do it effectively i
1,of the things we didnt do in our book was spend
1,or political science or education although the truth when i looked
1,made promotion free used to have to buy advertising or pr
1,than for a ugandan need staff on the ground keep in
1,of the monetary system as the government retired its debt it
1,so what happened to lending levels before and after what happened
1,person im perfectly comfortable with the idea that a blissful life
1,the people were killed nothing physical happened to the economys productive
1,dust would block the little irrigation holes in the tubes that
1,city running provide the police protection and the fire protection i
1,end but what gets it started the low interest rates the
1,clothes if you understand something you should be able to communicate
1,sort of thing so they grade strength of evidence they were
1,lie with addiction used to be that the use of alcohol
1,you buy an apple product or a zune from microsoft we
1,is spread out across many people as it would be in
1,europe they talk about all the extra leisure time but people
1,what role do constituents have in this process obviously thats going
1,vanilla space so we called of course that natural variable vanilla
1,dont believe that on the other hand i do think its
1,it as a public choice problem more than a payingattention problem
1,for their consumption and the payers of that subsidy are the
1,a data set and then we have to make some decisions
1,those debts which is national income basically 1512 i want to
1,attitudes toward their governments and the role they play in their
1,werebut some trackandfield and swimming for women were improving so rapidly
1,though smith didnt call it that now if you ask peoplefor
1,norm is that its okay to jaywalkif you can get across
1,observation do you like having them as colleagues do they make
1,things i point out in my book the expansion of schooling
1,and 1970s professors today centerleft coalition today has accepted a lot
1,that you could say to yourself hey im going to move
1,1970s breakdown but since then we could afford it investors and
1,purchasing power outside the united states holding everything else constant spending
1,to capture those gains if you put a tax on commuting
1,russ but lets keep on that story for a minute i
1,is in the camp of thinking that it is within the
1,those kinds of medical records but what they did have hospital
1,people from risk when things do go wrong they are remarkably
1,but bureaucrats are insulated from responsibility so might they take more
1,original book value of 60 million russ and now youve got
1,anything happen but just changes the costs and benefits at the
1,asking for donations thats the opposite of the way we think
1,is required by law to make that budget proposal but if
1,tactics but what can be realistic about fixing a system where
1,be inflexible i could have a longterm contract for my wage
1,will take care of roof and gutters could go around to
1,realside effects to just explain the deflation per se go back
1,to five years after a banking crises after five years many
1,is probably the most important of all russ i think its
1,is a different satoshi the person identified is actually named dorian
1,he can decide whether or not to let reid do what
1,schools some of the european reforms like forprofit schools promising privatization
1,unclear and there are differing interpretations in the scientific literature so
1,true of all the weight loss programs home organization schemes and
1,to reduce intake to moderate my calorie consumption even if thats
1,these french protestants fled and penn is actually making reference to
1,the fact that they receive food stamps its just that it
1,know russ hes going to die at the end guest hes
1,children and grandchildren whether they are going to get ahead or
1,do with a crippled economy underlying problem much deeper half those
1,put away for your 401k and everything but every manufacturer i
1,trouble so to the extent that the campaign goes on any
1,to get stuff done and your point is that yeah so
1,external academic evidence assessing the efficiency effects of these policies its
1,are just texting communicating as if you were sitting next to
1,could the us follow to help nigeria example british petroleum workers
1,trade everything including mortgagebacked securities in these markets with the slightest
1,also missing an opportunity from the unknown 1701 by contrast think
1,time stating what the growth rates would be and then theyd
1,so after five years businessmen no longer distrusted the government after
1,a partisan work by any means its hayeks booklength attempt to
1,for business people is not when the government spending actually happens
1,and this distinction between rules as rules versus rules as norms
1,they find a story to tell and theres a lot of
1,are the wrong ideals to have but they are incredibly ambitious
1,4 year time frame russ well its always good to quote
1,just a crutch sucking in the ignorant any evidence first compared
1,of human beings back to the ultimatum game people are very
1,the middle of the 18th century which is with monks scribbling
1,of mankind that they were selfish and grasping absolutely not youve
1,to move to a more rulebased system for adopting these things
1,central banks have been easier to hold private firms to their
1,number of market players for some reason coordinate expectationsthey start to
1,ruler or overseer she gathers her harvest in the fall to
1,that govern their existence so by the very nature of the
1,mcardle one of the reasons stem pays well isthey wont but
1,thats true i can remember the first political science course i
1,opinion questions that we ask that are kind of less scientific
1,sociopath if what you mean is i get away with everything
1,lot of change in china but not regime change not violence
1,3 tennis balls so to answer that question you have to
1,just research russ yeah i agree guest and insofar asand i
1,to be better for the independent its going to be the
1,your reaction a lot of people say in america in 1950
1,you discipline yourself never to leave the economist camp and to
1,the microeconomic literature typically is a variation of the point you
1,at economic variables that are fattailed meaning the probability doesnt matter
1,would probably go along so he was careful to put his
1,course this is a very complicated topic we are now in
1,this pool suppose a bank with mortgages on its books wants
1,one lowlevel drip riskless procedure with modest effects other intractable cases
1,burden is conjectured to have been the cause war is not
1,you need to get it into the shape where you can
1,true or not selfinterested propagandists spread a hatred for walmart there
1,made some bad decisions about what they should put up because
1,says adrian peterson of the minnesota vikings and think hed be
1,banks and yet the fed seems to have propped up everybody
1,dangerous than i think ronald reagan did i think i was
1,early years their relationship keynes was the older man he was
1,to a baseball game ourselves at the age of 10 glorious
1,wouldnt have to be corruption what youve pointed out in the
1,of the yuan to the dollar just before coming into your
1,effect revisited inflation targeting rather than money supply targeting friedmans claim
1,if it werent for the internet they couldnt make a living
1,didnt know that is that true guest i think so so
1,today is the economics of stimulus the mercatus center here at
1,finishing of the task the accomplishmentyou take the bow you walk
1,the goal of the original promoters in the late 1980s new
1,don and i talked about this podcast and he got me
1,mostly handles the payments for the elderly at the state level
1,we cant say for sure absolutely that that was wrong i

1,are two types of spending two classifications theres discretionary spending which
1,personal example on this point on productivityive told this story before
1,trade have become very complex last night my wife was looking
1,to education internet information world relative to 25 or 40 years
1,the house and they say well im not paying im getting
1,what causes labor inequality the difference between college graduates and high
1,look at the overhead ratio im not going to look at
1,the company than they would be as individuals and the bad
1,skillful come to work on time and to have good ideas
1,no european fiscal policy each nation has its own fiscal policy
1,in the business no guidance after school they really only prepare
1,feel for what the magnitudes are when you say it hasnt
1,very hard for outsiders to know as much about as the
1,boom and ive actually confirmed this more systematically with my colleague
1,positive reinforcement aversive behavior running from a tiger motivating those two
1,thats our best natural experimentwwii so i found in a government
1,foreign policy had been in place but i like to think
1,think back on my formal education i taught myself a ton
1,they looked at whats the poverty rate for married people with
1,our differences and i am open to becoming a nazi my
1,prefer to think there is a designer franklin roosevelt let people
1,do a mixture of art and science see that people like
1,once you get into politics you become a keynesian the political
1,is not true side by side they are taking our jobs
1,which pay lawyers alleging vaccine injury so they didnt need it
1,watched a lot of sporting events taped because i couldnt watch
1,slightly just a titch underestimated the size of that opportunity ohanian

1,no less the emotional hardship of dealing with this abnormal psa
1,if asset prices fell by a relatively small amount do you
1,textbook talk about savings money marketbut they are partial equilibrium even
1,fans or certainly those of us who dont play hockey dont
1,here would be its far better to reach an agreement with
1,a handful of women they may be wives of the economists
1,whereas they wouldnt describe themselves that way similarly youll hear people
1,he wanted to have his picture taken took picture then put
1,because thats the latest thing also humiliating if you have to
1,to support a larger number of people on the planet and
1,a lot of us spend time on the internet in very
1,care as economics would predict but their health outcomes were basically
1,same amount of labor today as it took 50 years ago
1,day had to borrow money to pay off the old money
1,bottom line which i think is so true is its just
1,im just back from brazil where they talk about the quantities
1,well its pollutionthey look for things obviously that have changed over
1,if i tell you that in this classroom your kid is
1,an effect obviously its bigger if its every year but i
1,was a dead enda wrong way to go in 1966 the
1,other forms of affection that we are used to and that

1,take cultural conditions into accountthe narratives people tell themselves larry iannaccones
1,the presidentthat was the first report with president kennedy and walter

1,now there are even more dramatic things that can be done
1,it possibly do that given the possiblyset right level of safety
1,think theres any reason why you couldnt replace the system we
1,forgot to say with regard to whether businesses are creativelest it
1,were doing it they didnt do it as much they were
1,pay more for experience of teachers but again on average that
1,about them too the most important being when it lost the
1,move in an institutionally antiseptic formal theory direction or in an
1,created by free market institutions in an open economy interesting that
1,them what are the consequences of this many things number one
1,idealistic countries powerful interest groups didnt want to let go of
1,is wall street right now in americaand id be interested in
1,as the keynesians admittedthere is a slight burden the distortionary effects
1,evidence either way ian ayres podcast not enough statistical analysis should
1,a story differentiation of product commercials tell stories rather than just
1,and tells voters what they are going to do for them
1,the internet in changing access to information what could we do
1,its only the monetary base thats expanded grotesquely russ and when
1,with people like arthur spiethoff they said one of their beliefs
1,i think i know the answer to the first part guest
1,about uncertainty and knows how to talk about the public good
1,the vast space of all possible animals weve actually been very
1,prompts them to invest in treasuries depressing the yields and fannie
1,isnt it these shows when you think about the criticisms of
1,mergers they have to go before the federal reserve board community
1,is this perpetratorvictim distinction unimportant in coases story guest well because
1,spring of 1977 guest are you that old russ i didnt
1,will change the law and find a way out 5317 so
1,in a position to receive benefits they wouldnt have received them
1,clever and interesting and could actually be true 1918 now were
1,which make such recommendations work how they come up with these
1,gets harmed russ correct agreed guest both have to be in

1,run in india for the poor for very small amounts of

1,power you cant put all of your faith in one kind
1,makes banks hate equity so much so you will tell your
1,to have the same incentive to be cautious about the future
1,down and look at the way the world is look at
1,how they can be used uniquely and there are not only
1,sheet metal around them difference in margins gm became more cynical
1,lets take one of your examples lets say i borrow 100000
1,its clearly good for tankmakers and what higgs argues is that
1,west small town hard to not shop at walmart those who
1,to reduce risk to depositors and others it seems to have
1,chapter in his economics textbook where he says is economics a
1,to the practice pointif you are 7 tall you have such
1,education infrastructure and this kind of integrated development lost favor with
1,make great wine leads to second sacremental wine leader in this
1,lack of capital but also difficulty of buying people out land
1,they trustcould be a sister do you shop with friends generally
1,can do it so you want to stop those guys pals
1,i needed to know was is every kid in school but
1,partnership in the late 1920s that most of the partners basically
1,just by itself okay so weve overelevated it weve overemphasized it
1,legitimate guest oh absolutely thats absolutely right theres a deep tension
1,custom in 1770s maybe even stronger connection sources 1 2 and
1,of a sudden you have to wonder am i doing this
1,in what 237 years of us history lowest rates in memory
1,basically means to consider buying when my 3yearold goes off to
1,them back in but less productive that private sector activity may
1,what we call struck off which is lose his license to
1,that well he had this kind of naive view and his
1,kind of superseniority in bankruptcy to all derivatives not only if
1,let puritans come by us or presbyterians or german lutherans in
1,minority that theres something traditionally called the problem of intensity in
1,the most obvious simplification but you say look if this is
1,a hypothesis and people say its obvious and its wrong its
1,controlled by individual reason does not learn in time where to
1,interest rates on his own belongia podcast greenspan did it six
1,they were right they were so precious guest so the very
1,tried to distinguish between general rules which he thought were admissible
1,that taxes would be unchanged this yearlets take sales taxes because
1,costbut i think the key issue here is effectiveness 2530 russ
1,grit or conscientiousnessthey turn often to explain more of the individuals
1,this is an interesting thing to explore for me because i
1,felt stupid afterwards theres a lot of opposition to obama on
1,fed steering the economy every once in a while disastrous misstep
1,sought by both parties as a progressive presidential candidate in 1920
1,its basically the independence part thats important it basically means that
1,people tend to save what is called transitory incomewindfalls nonrecurrent incomes
1,fact but it also applies to after the fact have a
1,ambitious russ thats true thats one of the challenges of a
1,that thing that when you do it you forget you are
1,america at the time guest actually i think ill answer that
1,may not have any successful way of fixing it but lets
1,these principles i think thats why it failedin the application stage
1,to get this drug and some of those people take the
1,gradual solution it could be one year two years three years
1,its not like 10 easy exercises its just reframing it to
1,theres still other things that we just dont know transportation used
1,are as a social psychologist who studies morality ive come to
1,quality as you say it tends to encourage people looking out
1,predict how many beavers would be alive in an ecosystem if
1,incompetence lets start there and then what happens with this incompetent
1,painful process debt magnifies our fortunes when things are going well
1,those businesses to gamble with other peoples money rather than their
1,price you buy it at still make money extremely long positionsportfolios
1,it works or not and well get to that a little
1,you examples that are deliberately sort of on the leading edge
1,of market failure precise notion focus on efficiency issuesthe allocation of
1,comes from the greek word to sit at the table correct
1,those kinds of things in his own way and was firmly
1,see that that path is foreclosed by unimaginative regulators well over
1,on were challenging when he was a grad student but gary
1,of its population at all so thats what i really worry
1,want to hear from those guys in terms ofthey are insiders
1,sets of skills that eventually if you continually start companies that
1,in in situations where there are cultural norms that make it
1,be looking at literacy and things like this my critique is
1,think a lot of people know that they are roughly that
1,that you want to mention guest yes and here ill mention
1,money on research that wont pan out so they ask for
1,of the average american who is not particularly worried about the
1,chickens than you do in a house like mine in suburbia
1,how is it that the chickens are going to end up
1,and im thrilled that they are making a lot more moneydoesnt
1,get improvements which will improve both sides and increase the level
1,i can make two economic predictions based on these technological forecasts
1,win in a landslide because of the fundamentals exactly whereas romney
1,you look at a lot of suburban parcels a lot of
1,way the world usually works successfully guest well especially at sea
1,know the answer to the first part guest im waiting for
1,find the phrase that is repeated the most is before asian
1,that turned out to be a very good time to raise
1,think its really due to the principalagent kind of problems theres
1,it into your ribs and break your ribs jam it into
1,lumbar punctures they were put through brain scanners drank radioactive drinks
1,part of economic growth but beyond that we dont seem to
1,here for a second the only thing i understand about kantwhich
1,understand a teacher im going to have to sit in their
1,than that it was spent at all russ absolutely guest i
1,why all the runners are coming from these impoverished rural areas
1,like everything you write and you have to make yourself do
1,computers and smart software i think those extend the reach of
1,thats interesting enough then maybe someone like carmen will be invited
1,kind of work we encouraged by our parents to do if
1,you did or unusual that you did this is something where
1,a member of congress you dont want to find out and
1,a lot of free market enterprise opportunities there high tax rateshard
1,up was the ldlbad cholesterol and what a mistakewhat a misadventure
1,we know thats not true what you just said is not
1,we also gain less on the other hand when the downturn
1,obligation that mutual support network makes it okay for me to
1,last couple of decades especially we have been overemphasizing the importance
1,want to kick up a fuss its also risky if its
1,part of the wheat out to someone else the wheat is
1,dont understand our industry is different and if you make us
1,as bear stearns didheld many of these assets backed by mortgages
1,about it i think it is a challenge to frame it
1,in the book that living standards in the united states are
