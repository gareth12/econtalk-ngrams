1,that completely overlooked and then making it available for people to have this debate about what it means the other thing is
1,a nonsolutionoriented approach russ you bet guest and thats interesting its a doubt approach that a lot of it is just getting

1,of thinkyou know theres incoherence in the answers that people give and its hard to infer all that stuff but i think
1,nowhere near the kinds of extremes that have occurred in the past thousand years in this country for sure where we have
1,hayekians or who have read the road to serfdom dont seem to have grasped i do think there are basic thingsif you
1,raises taxes more than the president has proposed and because it doesnt cut spending enough one thing we didnt talk about in
1,news and was hungry for history and they got none of it from their local radio stations so everyone from peasants on
1,of course that they retain the memory of where they are supposed to be going better and they pick up the skills
1,and forth so these two reinforce one another in a very subtle way so here is one way in which that reinforcement
1,one challenge to that view that ought to be thought about which is he says that its a view that emphasizes choice

1,build the lives they want and protects them from the worst risks that they might confront in modern life rather than a
1,view about experimentsif you do the experimental design adequately with controls and then do the randomization you will get a proper causal
1,i think it took quite a while before that could get anywhere so i think basically it wasnt a theoretical approach which
1,as many as they wanted voluntary import restraints heres the price take it or leave it alien world to what were now
1,testing the point there which is almost at the other end of the extreme hereand i dont want to oversimplify this but
1,the prices of the 5 metals basically doubles but whats striking to methe reason i love the chartis that simons view if
1,away the name they and history trashed him throughout the 30s hoover protested that he like roosevelt had been a big spender
1,trillion of those mortgages so that put option as we know from having bailed them out was no longer good so i

1,the permafrost melts all the methane the billions of tons of methane are released into the atmosphere each ton 50 times more
1,this so basically the preeminent desire of religious leaders is to maximize market shareif we can put this into economic terms we
1,diminish as the level of aid to gdp rises and fundamentally the thing that is going to affect peoples economic opportunity throughout
1,very unpleasant which is very difficult for any nation to do and particularly maybe this one they would spend less raise more
1,that doesnt affect the employment rate very much because it hammers rich people doesnt mean its not going to affect gdp and

1,large part of the post 1950s resurgence of economic thinking russ i think you mean post 1948 guest okay yeah russ because
1,to increase aggregate demand so spending does that monetary policy can do it so we have this sort of magic cure that

1,that 23 13 on payments to the states and 13 on various socalled expansionary activities of various kinds and that was done
1,in the ground and they are enormous and they are going to come due in a generation so there is a kind
1,trouble with people on the sell side which is i would like to have my own data back when we are done
1,going on how do you know if you are running a restaurant that your customers coming in have a job because of
1,really greece because the greek economy is about 2 or was about 2 of the eurozone economy a shocking number by the

1,just games and a little practice on the side they are weight lifting and training year round and because of what economists
1,buddhists there and then you also have the jewish population that was interspersed throughout there whats interesting about these different churches was
1,different results between different studies and thats exactly what youd expect if you are testing contemporaneous relationships versus short term relationships versus
1,were people so negative about the fiscal policies roosevelt not seen as a saviour by 1938 mixing up two or three different
1,limit is a mushier deadline for two reasons one is the one you describe which is you are making projections about the
