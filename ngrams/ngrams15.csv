1,the piece if we did have somebody that everyone trusts the odds would be good
1,liberal constitution is if you are trying to figure out under the species of eternity
1,and to me it reminds me ofand cookbooks as well remind me offly fishing so
1,you would claim there is very little evidence that those two things matter very much
1,whether this holds widely or narrowly but certainly in many privatesector transactions if you overreach
1,was the opening bars of if i had a million dollars by bare naked ladies
1,more people who are going to be angry at you for that than the one
1,argument is more tanks tankmakers have more money they spend it that stimulates the butter
1,the private labor force by young elderly and women who before the war had no

1,in coaseall externalities are essentially reciprocal would be the more productive way more useful way
1,largely made up of jewish garment workers from the east end of london welsh and
1,them so i was rather struck by the fact that you said we have something
1,reasons why there might not be something in the data set one is the data
1,come out of the bluesure theres not much monopoly and what would be the big
1,is that at least when you see this reduction in colas they do reduce the
1,laid off tweet on this particular one its an old one 5429 anything else fun
1,quite wrong because they constantly concentrate on the fact that every spring the vast majority
1,be russ assessed guest promoted and developed and assessed and just as important as shaking
1,you like the way its constituted another way to ask it what incentives does the
1,cut through those annoying constraints we could fix stuff like they do whats wrong with
1,argued that the quantity of money in the short run had real impacts on the
1,discovery process we dont know what theyll do or discover just let them go alternative
1,all over europe italy germanybig chemical industry origin we took technology after wwii natural product
1,to make it absolutely perfect russ i almost bought one i came very close it
1,of analysis from you one is what do you think we ought to do in
1,in terms of timing than the smith story ricardian story is about a point in
1,is pure speculation on my part but let me give you another example which is
1,climate or think we dont know what were talking about or talk about complexities as
1,to play the keynesianqualitative easingof course we have to turn to government spending because monetary
1,securities and exchange commission sec which im going to say that i think that the
1,units as we call them that you can think about the idea here is that
1,is if you are imposing capital requirements on banks visavis basel iii and you are
1,years and the mayor made an announcement last week there will be no more annexation
1,repealed and when you go before the voters every two or four years or whatever
1,past to take us to the future we need to build our own infrastructure and
1,of the country is just going in another direction the younger generations those of us
1,that a documented worker a citizen or permanent worker will take it then you have
1,that run from san francisco to chicago and they compete furiously for business there is
1,are administered by any form of government if we feel that government has fallen into
1,see a quick progression of records that then has diminishing returns but also a lot
1,certainly true we care about a lot more than just money certainly true that the
1,1920s and built up a credit bubble done it during a genuine period of high
1,us to the france story what happens if the central bank gets more gold but
1,although of course the speed is going to be affected a little bit and also
1,austrian no longer has the kind of demonic possessionbut i didnt mean possessiondemonic halo that
1,said obviously the economic prediction would be a shift in revenue toward the players the
1,go to the literature which youve done a magnificent job surveying i suspect you read
1,explain this it was one thing to explain the birth of the modern economies and
1,would by definition open themselves up to opportunistic exploitation that constitutes what bob frank would
1,not totally im willing to accept the possibility they are right but when people talk
1,we were asking for a particular blood type for one person who was about to
1,was high in alternative activities like working on a farm or doing household chores was
1,is when people behave in a way thats too generous too trustworthy too kind to
1,change associated with greenhouse warming and the models the climate models are very ambiguous about
1,emerging from the decrease in subsidies so its not going to happen overnight but it
1,will always be chemists who will try and help you cheat and there will always
1,a deli could all be equally skilled get specialization just because with enough economic activity
1,just a coincidence but thats to protect the consumerit could be their argument is that
1,do about it people find that helpful on the other hand to call something a
1,always been we need to make better tests for sure lets put the effort in
1,then they paid us our feea hindsight calculation puts our fees at 401 of the
1,trouble you are closed on friday and opened on monday thats the standard fdic federal
1,and people found inconsistency but they didnt realize what seneca said he was not against
1,to maybe move away from the aca or obamacare if obama wins presumably its going
1,and skeptical of this romance about autocracywe have to face the fact that even though
1,have to become more open and transparent in order to retain its legitimacy number two
1,in the past where there have been sudden crashes and sudden growth and temporarily people
1,going back to our question about sitting aroundthey literally have money sitting around they might
1,no other state has done or at least is not common which is they offered
1,which we cant test directly apply the drug if it works we might conclude it
1,to do but i think certainly from the personal perspective that was probably the best
1,would be the keynesian response to the austrian story the conditions under which markets work
1,starting line 2304 example in book farmers got a field of a certain width and
1,to increase their power and its a little bit of an open question of where
1,government could do the borrowing period of moderate to low inflation initially then came the
1,the story that i suggested politics is playing out by responding to lobbying campaign contributions
1,adopt ideas and if we only as people of freedom people who care about liberty
1,day of reckoning down the road with no hope of ever having it be positive
1,moderation which suddenly ended in late 2008 fed allowed nominal gdp to fall sharply below
1,for and that just simply forecast the massive swing they turned in a year later
1,tissue you just have to increase your expenditure decrease your intake and then your body
1,that make parenting challenging are not fun not fun for the kid not fun for
1,bet you cannot guess who said this in 1999 this is about japan what continues
1,why didnt they damp it part of it was the incentives the government provided for
1,very long periods of time and its mainly i think driven by our increasing wealth
1,and paternalism towards poor people that weve already talked about which is easier to understand
1,what does monetary policy have to do with the mess that we are in right
1,up at once money is one half of all exchanges goods trade for money barter
1,lot of education writ large or try to i ask you the question because theres
1,actually negative a lot of this debate goes on about whether the multiplier is bigger
1,close to us and if we try to take that to the larger order we
1,do we attribute the relative stability of the economy business cycle seems to be smoother
1,those large complex holding companies holding companies every customer every creditor every counterparty of every
1,best interests at heart to have the right motives want people around you to care
1,opportunity meaning two goods of the same quality were selling for different prices which means
1,correct a mistake that makes everybody including me better off the person i bought it
1,do you do with a crippled economy underlying problem much deeper half those who have
1,over the dutch in the 16th century and the hapsburgs try and extract too much
1,wish that people on the right would be more honest about that there were 3
1,for an upstart currency to overcome some of the advantages of an incumbent currency you
1,when they are young if they are living outside and eating a lot of raw
1,little ranty there i should have warned the listeners 722 guest i think thats just
1,what kind of reaction do you get from people when you tell them that in
1,these states and so in some of these moments you have a senate delegation that
1,development processis that out of the department of commerce i forget or it will be
1,they pick up there so when you average that across the country most people agree
1,a choiceyou have to do this to some extent by yourself there isnt another option
1,in human history and of course its not advantageous if youve got a very narrow
1,on the 80 million dollar loan now guest eventually but ill refinance it three more
1,need more in total where is that money going to come from lets not do
1,wicked man had trotsky mounted to power would still have been a oneparty terrorist oneideology
1,immediately associated with him just go out and take stuff from the people so that
1,you point out thats not necessarily their biggest problem guest no russ it is a
1,the question is were people dropping dead then but they didnt know it was a
1,need measures directly to regulate financial markets we need to focus on that rather than
1,so lets move to the bet the bet itself its quite an extraordinary moment in
1,a mix of good and bad depending on your philosophy but volker is chair of
1,how literally to read destruction russ thats true guest i thought this was interesting that
1,are producing valuable things for this oil we are made wealthier as a consequence so
1,clients of our risk firm were using us as a rubber stamp they werent even
1,they too able to have agricultural resources oxen out in the field and so onthat
1,very telling he told me that he didnt think that the rating agencies would ever
1,poor recognize that even if they behave in the most rational way we posit for
1,globalization market having high skills or a great brand or a great ability to sing
1,are suggesting that despite their extraordinarily low labor costs which would certainly be part of
1,that when people are underwater in their homes when companies are essentially underwater on their
1,but those reserves didnt go into the economy the classical mechanism by which the fed
1,leading manufacturing in the world we just dont employ as many people in it as
1,people compare the median in say 1973 to today or the bottom 20 or the
1,for 1 out of 5 teachers that is doing a really bad job and we
1,he said if you look at m2 thats the thing to look at guest thats
1,the fed from monetarists which has been very interesting right now were talking about the
1,someone who has access to world class health care they have a firstrate health insurance
1,is that its really important when you are editing your work that you put it
1,if you know the twintotwin evidence on happiness the idea your kid wasnt picked up
1,examples of people who got bullied we had people on the inside telling us some
1,as the factory manager told me theres nothing she does in her current job that
1,against it the republicans pushed it through guest it was actually henry steagall of alabama
1,your credit card company is you have to trust them with your money and sometimes
1,more of a siliconvalleytype of contract with less guaranteed benefits and more stock options so
1,am a sports fan one other aspect is theres a story every time but we
1,rejected as dangerously radical and unbecoming of a dignified economy so hes amazed that people
1,as your paradigm is wrong if you believe obesity is just about eating too much
1,place the ignorance in that literally the ignorance of experts about what is really going
1,both in europe and the united states gave rise to different treatises like for instance
1,times as much as people doing the same work elsewhere in the world russ yeah
1,know something we should remember 10055 russ one thing you didnt talk about is the
1,both of the reagansappointed head of the agency because of that personal relationship very strongly
1,call the vig 645 the book is the best treatment ive seen so far of
1,most learned and had fabulous memory and managed to make associations yeats only connect schumpeter
1,assumptions which ensure that these models have nothing to do with really existing capitalism so
1,1 but it was done incorrectly in the sense that the deal was forced on
1,induce liquidity in the system money growth wasnt all that high we got a little
1,that i often hearim a kind of libertarian economist in terms of my own politicspeople
1,field that had already a kind of competition was a good idealike that was a
1,908 russ so if i eat lots of calories and watch a lot of television
1,could do even better than the market but of course as hayek and mises argued
1,is this a reasonable argument to make about the value problems because locks on our
1,it as some time in august treasury tells us august 2nd i dont think they
1,a lecture part of that is learning the technology and then part of it is
1,ways not that they were teaching to the test things people worried about these were
1,russ its dangerous too guest yeah exactly for someone who doesnt have that and is
1,each workout with a little brief sprint on the stationary bicycle get in there and
1,became a very frequent guest on the tonight show and hes a very witty combative
1,data some are notthey are just pundits or smart economists who are talking about this
1,watching people take feedback and inferring whether they are good at it we should just
1,simply saying that would be a more plausible reason i would think russ mark twain
1,save when they get married most estimates are something like i think its like 35
1,the square root you just talked about guest no not even doing that russ you
1,on russ sometimes theres too much information guest yeah there was too much information and
1,for the first 450 years of the newspaper business it was a brutally competitive business
1,middle class we hear a lot of talk about the middle class as disappearing colleague
1,about credibility important lets come back to that the reason i like rules instead of
1,an increasingly dynamic place you want to make it as easy as you can for
1,get solutions but they will all be the same solution because the people have been
1,some austrian in him im sort of conflicted by this part of the conversation 2714
1,benign interpretation is these guys might not know of each other i think thats the
1,to pay as much attention as you and i would to what fields the students
1,silicon valley and they are struggling to find people with the skills to develop computing
1,the best you can 1535 1501 before we go to your particular work two special
1,the kind of innovation that has all sorts of benefits for jobs is innovation that
1,strangers they would be able to give a reasonable guess that would be correlated with
1,poor and so the second thing that a medicaid program can do and this varies
1,fulfilled highproductivity employment opportunities have expanded and structural change has contributed to overall growth but
1,to say something about sleep and life by comparison and i think models are like
1,lots of free reserves building up in the system and the fed was very nervous
1,just to buy the land for your corporate headquarters is enormous the salaries youve got
1,are the original equipment oe the original equipment manufacturers are the ones who make products
1,bewildering because it does go against their arithmetic preconceptions of x divided by y if
1,losses that most likely he wont have to bear perfectly acceptable to take that risk
1,with it figuring it out in the absence of any outside reward primates have biological
1,a classical lender of last resort necessarily on those occasions it did do some lastresort
1,you a test tied to the diagnostic criteria one of the things they want to
1,little more why well look at the tea party movement the tea party movement is
1,that to dismiss the dominant tradition of the 20th century as not being in the
1,im obsessed with practice but i think his book is also to some degree about
1,dont think is the most effective way to limit risk russ and you are also
1,enough money to cover his payroll that week and they made it and i always
1,that these authorities make up but god knows why they make those stories up or
1,the things you talk about in the book is that some of the habits and
1,some of it also is just disengagement that to be a political radical you need
1,you also wrote euclidean geometry was once styled the science of space but calling it
1,the first discoveries of behavioral economics literature daniel kahneman and amos tverskyloss aversion the idea
1,under water and i cannot keep my promises and im bankrupt guest well you might
1,liberalization started about ten years ago 25 times greater price received by farmers today vs
1,is too heavyhanded sacrifice too much of gdp goal to reduce pollution and not going
1,if they werent sports fans i wouldnt have strong feelings one way or the other
1,agree with that i think thats a very profound idea and i think that is
1,terribly overhyped there are some relatively unusual circumstances where vitamin d should be taken but
1,interesting about and is so profoundthis one table as we go through it is i
1,is closed different networks cable tv closed network mobile networks proprietary books newspapers more competition
1,truly green car i was thinking it would probably look something more like a golf
1,off the table guest it seems to me youve really assisted my argument all of
1,the me business want to get the book out there to be read publisher is
1,we are talking about health care being the most obvious onewould you want to go
1,center of court without having hit you know thousands of backhands or done thousands of
1,like sweets but we have learned to subdue it because there are also drawbacks 3214
1,point they lit a car on fire and they smashed a window in the millennium
1,cant find a single term and try to associate yourself with these complex views of
1,were described as being at the time argument was that the contracts were all tied
1,on same here we didnt have much either evidently it was in many ways a
1,always thought was important is the vacuum sealing because without that youve got a much
1,party romantic economists idea that it was cobdens eloquence but it was probably the actions
1,so what do you think was the turning point scheverdnadze reykjavik at reykjavik it was
1,to the mean to the totals russ explain guest in other words let me explain
1,for it at all russ so im going to read another quote from the book
1,not as direct but its still there if you think about the gi bill so
1,skiers of all time and olympians talk briefly about what role genetics played in his
1,lot ofagain i think most of great teaching is a mix of that inspiration and
1,profound thinking of yourself as being observed not comfortable place to be thinking about it
1,a liaison called the key account manage or national account manager or and they will
1,of subtle guest yeah but you read newspapers sayingi just grimace because the journalists dont
1,saying im going to charge the most that i can get because otherwise what would
1,other thingright right russ the nature of cronies is to say we need free markets
1,through training programs this was targeting not the maddies of the world but people who
1,there in the fatal conceit and there are extensions talking about cultural evolution and recent
1,the policy was basically contractionary in its intent and thats pretty generally accepted now it
1,in the united states had an important effect on making things more stable at a
1,we ought to put them into effect and so he has very little interest in
1,its extremely difficult to start a new enterprise is that part of the story well
1,be the one we are talking aboutthat the only way to go to a good
1,better life and realized he had a pretty good talent for crosscountry skiing but when
1,may benefit me because i buy it i forgot that i needed it i pick
1,would unfold one of my favorite shows is wicked and the first act ends with
1,of factors behind new business formation i think taxes are one part of the story
1,power and that therefore economics which certainly has less predictive power than biology nevertheless has
1,challenge and get your reaction a lot of people say in america in 1950 if
1,at about a 45 per annum rate i should say year over year the year
1,crisis its why does that impact labor markets so much russ which is not obvious
1,and large it does it relatively well there are circumstances in which it doesnt function
1,of it those of you out there who have listened this fari dont know how
1,of this russ or what about that the ultimate people who are going to pay
1,see half empty to a large extent lets close lets talk about why you are
1,but wreak havoc with the production methods of other people who supply cheaper labor and
1,counterintuitive you mean water and sugar is better than a medicine injected into the body
1,software behind that little gadget that is doing the work somebody had to come up
1,going to hurt the people you are trying to help whats your reaction to those
1,is if we go to the standard language of keynesian and modern economics whats often
1,less influence than people who see friedman as a maligned force would have one belief
1,want to be around him guest yeah russ even though they are mean they draw
1,the pace of innovation is pretty healthy we dont know what the alternative world would
1,china if he was to lose his little finger paltry misfortune of his own we
1,aside money today have to save without savings without growth still true the nature of
1,on wall street because they were banked by the little smalltown bank in missouri or
1,actually looked at is you know the obama jobs bill from a couple years ago
1,they had a whole bunch of state enterprises operating inefficiently behind barriers to trade and
1,issues guest yes the fraction of income going to players would be substantially lower if
1,and it was just a much different experience than it was 15 years ago fifteen
1,colonial times and i think thats kind of an important clue because it kind of
1,successes in another field who are generally elevated in age so the key is to
1,southern part of israel where its extremely hot we worked from 4 am to about
1,is a very different problem in the united states they dont have enough power as
1,value and market values reflect spontaneous order riots for underpriced goods role of uniqueness in
1,sorts of ways we are not making the argument that even under conditions of free
1,was insolvent on a marketvalue basis and collectively by mid1982of course this wasnt realized for
1,that there were problems brewing but had gone from very few banks to dozens of
1,know how persuasive they are to noneconomists but my first thought is once you give
1,point is that if you look at where the big failures are they seem to
1,cant protect himself against a contagious disease unless everyone is protected similarly impossible to be
1,has sharply increased in the 1980s and sort of stabilized in the 1990s increased again
1,be an even bigger failure from insolvency when this happens so along comes continental illinois
1,are a kid to just change your life on your own some kids actually do
1,so the more successful you were in creating these models which gave you discursive power
1,national output that we produce is about 17 trillionwe are talking about 205 trillion which
1,growth doesnt matter i think thats just the wrong conclusion to reach there are all
1,microfinance the fact that its not measurable at the aggregate level may not be the
1,you have to eat less exercise more and the other is that heart disease is
1,says look you are correct to believe that education increases the earnings of the individual
1,wouldnt be causal or why there would be some third factor thats causal russ or
1,performance enhancing and b can we test for it russ i agree thats a stupid
1,as has every other baby boomer including you the demographics have notthe demographics actually have
1,going to do so to make people happy people have fun become addicted because they
1,have had a voice thats not the case any more it developed into a huge
1,drive home this idea that law is very much like market prices they are the
1,you point out in the book you tell that great story about the moroccan person
1,through socalled artificial intelligence rather than the mere replication of a human brain shouldnt put
1,fully libertarian society was that if you got halfway there everybody would be so rich
1,way of looking at this problem relative to the economists both men werent alone a
1,institutions in botswana survived and then one more lucky thingthe precolonial institutions in many places
1,lot more in the way of municipal bankruptcies disputes about who is first in linepensioners
1,artists sometimes virally use the webwilco tremendous experiencewent into label wanted a better record took
1,could have decided to flip the switch and say life is good enough at this
1,10 and the defenders said it would have gone even higher if it hadnt been
1,is convexity convexity is when you lose a penny to make a dollar when being
1,on with dread diseases like cancer or heart disease they dont tend to live very
1,the government increases its saving at the same time the effect will be a downturn
1,lands value doesnt have anything to do with productive contribution land grows more scarce its
1,guarantee behind it and when i asked him how he could possibly trust the ratings
1,everything you do actually makes the real problem worse the driving problem worse lets make
1,econometrics faithbased are we finding truth rhetorical question we emphasize the grammar and syntax teaching
1,actually i think they make more luigi but lets use that as a rough approximation
1,about the difficulties of inferring cause and effect the fed stepped in substantially and basically
1,that we live heremeaning this certain mix of low density urbanish but not too urban
1,them all we can conclude is that we know that communistic organization and allocation of
1,us but do you think that change in the top 1 has something to do
1,correctly guest thats right russ they were friends he may have just been encouraging i
1,at it and only see bad things happening incompetent people who are worse than what
1,not just well i weighed all the facts and i came to religion or i
1,connections matter so much that people are going to make the allocations not on the
1,experience that happens there some of it can be destructive of courseyou are waiting for
1,you a few minutes to start preparing people would start making frantic notes every few
1,data points in which a country had received more than 15 of gdp in aid
1,about it too so its not a secret that this profit opportunity is allegedly out
1,seem to be signs of a recovery but they aborted this effort to expand the
1,adverse selection happens when you know more about your health than the insurance company so
1,to relearn it waging wars to satisfy debt obligations entire package of things you dont
1,i saw it yeah i could grade it pretty quickly guest yeah now on the
1,wearing on the street they want to see how people are mixing and matching and
1,my bitcoin receiving addresses the amount you want to pay me and press the send
1,then it goes into a second peeler as a kind of quality control how much
1,make a credible promise that you will let firms fail whats to be done given
1,the market and then the fda will look through all of these trials and if
1,income tax revenue was falling dramatically it made the repeal of prohibition more attractive world
1,by helping them go to college even though most of the jobs dont require college
1,to be diseases that i didnt even know was a disease like oh those lettuce
1,see that happening guest i agree entirely one of the biggest obstacles is trying to
1,gold mine some risk your job to look expect rating agency to read carefully but
1,not medicare and i know a lot of people who arent well versed in the
1,are coming from these impoverished rural areas in 2008 in the united states there was
1,just made which is i dont have any idea other than the author of the
1,labor market because once you receive the benefit as i said its an annuity so
1,because it has any value in itself but because the one who takes paper money
1,about 1000 characters and some of them were logograms but most of them were syllabogramsthey
1,thing for a minute if i could look into beethovens brain creating the 9th symphony
1,larva at birth but in most species like harvester ants their tasks change as they
1,rosty and tell me what you think about this and the response is overwhelmingly positive
1,there wont be just one there will be many implementations to choose from maybe some
1,way we look at the figures and one of them is about the time horizon
1,nominal gdp from falling sharply monetary policy should not be focusing so much on interest
1,designing new rules in the united states that means the economy is going to be
1,see the order in our desk or neatening our house up but theres an order
1,they are worried about relative status suicide contest if your relative preferences really matter russian
1,its going to make is solve our problem of mortality will solve immortality for us
1,both vincent and lins contribution is to see them both pushing for overcoming this stale
1,marginal tax rates and that you would need to get rid of the mortgage tax
1,book he wrote or vice versa theres also no reference in the wn to many
1,some of their most important writings were in response to one another their disagreement extended
1,get here from there five tragedies last quarter of the 18th century is big band
1,which might seem like im talking about aggregationbut our explanation is a microeconomic explanation and
1,in the nonprofit sector but excuse me its those people that make a lot of
1,bring it to the new science of administration divide between civil societywhich is made up
1,not romney or bachmann rick perrytexass deficit is now bigger than californias because california picked
1,is a big advocate of recapitalizing banks russ yep guest part of it is a
1,not think is a good place for him to be running for president but the
1,company called tesla announces its going into production with an all electric roadster twoperson car
