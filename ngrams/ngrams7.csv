6,what do you think of that argument
6,i think thats part of the reason
6,what do you think of that guest
6,what are we going to do about
6,russ our topic for today is your
6,more likely to be in prison or
6,how do we get there from here
5,is that there is a lot of
5,lets take the con out of econometrics
5,the monetary history of the united states
5,you talk about in the book is
5,hayek the curious task of economics is
5,i think a lot of people have
5,you have some interesting things to say
5,you are going to get a very
5,i think theres some truth to that
5,this is one of the things that
5,the federal reserve bank of new york
5,well put a link up to it
5,the right way to think about it
5,that have nothing to do with the
5,there are going to be a lot
5,what does that have to do with
5,there are a couple of things that
5,in the united states over the last
5,i think thats part of the problem
5,2014 russ our topic for today is
5,i dont know what the answer is
5,i dont think we are going to
5,i think thats a huge part of
5,what you have to do is to
5,a decline in the velocity of money
5,in the united states in the last
5,there are all sorts of things that
5,to be in prison or jail than
5,there are a lot of people in
5,do you want to say anything about
5,take the job that pays the most
5,demonstrate to men how little they really
5,they are not going to be able
4,let me ask you a different question
4,let me ask you a question about
4,think there are two things that are
4,and one of the things that is
4,the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act
4,if you go back and look at
4,are going to be a lot of
4,well put a link up to that
4,are going to make a lot of
4,because at the end of the day
4,a lot of what we are doing
4,how to get the most out of
4,of our present difficulty is that we
4,the united states off the gold standard
4,so what you end up with is
4,lets talk a little bit about the
4,in the case of fannie and freddie
4,you are going to be able to
4,do you want to say anything else
4,by the time you get to the
4,i think theres a lot to be
4,it reminds me a little bit of
4,in the united states a lot of
4,have some interesting things to say about
4,chairman of the council of economic advisers
4,the organization for economic cooperation and development
4,to figure out how it is that
4,for a couple of reasons one is
4,would seem to be a good thing
4,and you are the easiest person to
4,dont put all your eggs in one
4,fool yourself and you are the easiest
4,what they imagine they can design and
4,sell something for more than it is
4,russ let me ask you about one
4,demonstrate to men how little they know
4,what do you mean by that and
4,i think this is one of the
4,part of our present difficulty is that
4,talk about in the book is the
4,there is a lot of uncertainty about
4,that there is no such thing as
4,take risks for the sake of others
4,i think a lot of people who
4,yourself and you are the easiest person
4,if you look at the history of
4,what we are going to talk about
4,because i think a lot of people
4,no such thing as a free lunch
4,to come to a group of people
4,in the early part of the 20th
4,russ our topic for today is a
4,the early part of the 20th century
4,a lot of what we do in
4,to figure out what to do with
4,i dont know whats going to happen
4,going to make a lot of money
4,and i think a lot of people
4,i think a lot of people would
4,spend a lot of time in the
4,be in prison or jail than are
4,there are a lot of things in
4,at the height of the financial crisis
4,money back 100 cents on the dollar
4,at the expense of the rest of
4,you are the easiest person to fool
4,you want to say anything else about
4,i talk about in the book is
4,are more likely to be in prison
4,that at the end of the day
4,over the last 40 or 50 years
4,what we can do is we can
4,the other point i want to make
4,and so on and so forth so
4,put all your eggs in one basket
4,the fact of the matter is that
4,but i think a lot of people
4,an inquiry into the nature and causes
4,are going to go out of business
4,think we can teach people to be
4,something for more than it is worth
4,what kind of reaction have you gotten
4,or whatever you want to call it
4,there were a lot of people who
4,think theres a lot to be said
4,a good thing or a bad thing
4,thing to do is the thing that
3,to illustrate to men how little they
3,would crush them so we must learn
3,you point out in the book there
3,to steal a euro from an old
3,point out there are a lot of
3,i dont want to be unfair to
3,crush them so we must learn to
3,on the other hand i dont think
3,lot of people thought it would be
3,to get the most out of life
3,what do you think about that guest
3,the fed is paying interest on reserves
3,of the problems with that is that
3,the best lack all conviction while the
3,what does it have to do with
3,the discount rate that we apply to
3,to a group of people set their
3,and so on and so forth but
3,study of how to get the most
3,of human action but not human design
3,this is the kind of thing that
3,and i want to come back to
3,what weve been talking about so far
3,for a very very long time and
3,you think of that guest i think
3,that there is going to be a
3,want to come back to that in
3,as you point out there are a
3,one way to think about this is
3,we are still in the middle of
3,out of the 18th century and put
3,its a little more complicated than that
3,deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia which
3,we were always to apply the rules
3,guest i think thats right i think
3,are a lot of things that arent
3,that they dont have any interest in
3,i would go so far as to
3,while the worst are full of passionate
3,of the people who are going to
3,i think its going to be a
3,dont want to live in a world
3,of what we are talking about here
3,to our more intimate groupings we would
3,on what they did with the money
3,it will be interesting to see how
3,extended order to our more intimate groupings
3,russ let me ask you a question
3,we dont have to worry about it
3,the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act
3,the people you are trying to help
3,i agree with you in the sense
3,from the international monetary fund imf and
3,lives our thoughts and our emotions in
3,thats not what we are talking about
3,at the end of the day a
3,there is a lot of evidence that
3,i want to talk about some of
3,learn to live in two sorts of
3,on a scale of 1 to 10
3,us wish to do we would destroy
3,which the articles of confederation did not
3,but i want to go back to
3,you point out there are a lot
3,its just a matter of time before
3,often make us wish to do we
3,at the end of the book you
3,is that there are a lot of
3,what are your thoughts on how we
3,you have to take that into account
3,they know about what they imagine they
3,in the world to come to a
3,the austrian theory of the business cycle
3,clause of the 14th amendment which says
3,i live in the washington dc area
3,we talk a lot on this program
3,best lack all conviction while the worst
3,been going on for a long time
3,china is going to get ahead of
3,we are going to talk about today
3,of the themes of the book is
3,figure out how it is that you
3,the articles of confederation did not have
3,are a lot of things that we
3,we are going to talk about the
3,that there is such a thing as
3,so one of the things that we
3,for a very long period of time
3,adjust our lives our thoughts and our
3,one of the problems with that is
3,is that one of the things that
3,part of what we are talking about
3,one of the things that i think
3,of the things i talk about in
3,russ i want to go to a
3,concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
3,in a way that i think is
3,come to a group of people set
3,you talk about this in the book
3,i think the more important point is
3,we dont have a very good understanding
3,intimate groupings we would crush them so
3,russ our topic for today is the
3,we are going to be talking about
3,are a lot of people in the
3,the fact that we were able to
3,and all of a sudden you have
3,what do you think are the most
3,there are a lot of things we
3,apply the rules of the extended order
3,right thing to do is the thing
3,to that in a second but i
3,think this is going to be a
3,one of the things i learned from
3,has done a lot of work on
3,a lot of ruin in a nation
3,ie of the small band or troop
3,it comes back to your earlier point
3,the world was coming to an end
3,out in the middle of nowhere and
3,that the division of labor is limited
3,and so one of the things that
3,i think there are a couple of
3,one social science and we are its
3,the rules of the extended order to
3,some of them will have to do
3,men how little they know about what
3,80 million in loans 20 million in
3,the job that pays the most money
3,you are not going to get any
3,the government increases its spending by 1
3,those of you who are out there
3,the right thing to do is the
3,were always to apply the rules of
3,little they know about what they imagine
3,ladies and gentlemen serving ladies and gentlemen
3,i think a lot of people will
3,million in loans 20 million in cash
3,i want to start by asking you
3,way to think about it i think
3,world to come to a group of
3,are led by an invisible hand to
3,you must not fool yourself and you
3,if we are going to have a
3,guest well i think there are two
3,me ask the question a different way
3,what we are talking about here is
3,there are two ways to get to
3,to do it in a way that
3,our lives our thoughts and our emotions
3,are on the left or the right
3,they have a lot of political power
3,the only way we are going to
3,we dont know how to do it
3,does that have to do with the
3,what do you mean by that guest
3,the cruelest things in the world to
3,to apply the rules of the extended
3,one of the things that struck me
3,amount of rain thats fallen since the
3,has been going on for a long
3,the end of the book you talk
3,the central bank of the united states
3,as you point out a lot of
3,do you think of that guest well
3,the extended order to our more intimate
3,what we have to do is to
3,let me ask the question a different
3,at the beginning of the 20th century
3,the study of how to get the
3,russ but as you point out in
3,i think its one of the most
3,we were to apply the unmodified uncurbed
3,of people set their hearts on fire
3,but lets put that to the side
3,microcosmos ie of the small band or
3,and i think one of the things
3,insurance corporation improvement act fdicia which was
3,are a couple of things that are
3,i want to come back to this
3,i make in the book is that
3,a lot of people who dont like
3,which you talk about in the book
3,in the last 10 years or so
3,must not fool yourself and you are
3,and i have talked about this before
3,in the aftermath of the 2008 financial
3,if we were to apply the unmodified
3,make the world a better place and
3,but i want to come back to
3,in the last 10 or 15 years
3,are going to have to make a
3,turns out to be one of the
3,person on the other side of the
3,ratio of the 90th to the 50th
3,our topic for today is a recent
3,that there was going to be a
3,yearnings often make us wish to do
3,and one of the things that i
3,you give the example in the book
3,only one social science and we are
3,sentimental yearnings often make us wish to
3,always to apply the rules of the
3,but on the other hand there are
3,and then all of a sudden they
3,there are a lot of reasons why
3,where do you think we are headed
3,going to lose a lot of money
3,difficulty is that we must constantly adjust
3,in the middle of the 20th century
3,are going to get a very different
3,oecd organization for economic cooperation and development
3,conviction while the worst are full of
3,well i think thats right i think
3,they just have different friends but they
3,one of the things he says is
3,what does this have to do with
3,whether you are on the left or
3,and i think theres a lot of
3,when you are in the middle of
3,theres a lot of ruin in a
3,something you talk about in the book
3,up in front of the class and
3,group of people set their hearts on
3,things going on at the same time
3,what the right thing to do is
3,their friends they just have different friends
3,money to their friends they just have
3,the test group versus the control group
3,going to do they are going to
3,small band or troop or of say
3,the worst thing you can do is
3,there are many ways in which they
3,dont do a very good job of
3,thats going to be one of the
3,to sell something for more than it
3,you spend a lot of time on
3,has to do with the fact that
3,is that if you look at the
3,of course there are a lot of
3,wish to do we would destroy it
3,in the journal of law and economics
3,i thought you were going to say
3,economics is the study of how to
3,it seems to me one of the
3,do we know anything about that guest
3,what the rules of the game are
3,from the point of view of a
3,dont think we have a very good
3,so why dont you talk about what
3,the worst are full of passionate intensity
3,there are studies that find that aid
3,we would crush them so we must
3,past returns are no guarantee of future
3,and get your reaction to it which
3,up on the library of economics and
3,in the last 3 or 4 years
3,i think its more than that i
3,they are going to be able to
3,think one of the things that is
3,the small band or troop or of
3,end of the book you talk about
3,one of the points i make in
3,them so we must learn to live
3,by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic
3,theres going to be a lot of
3,adam smith in the theory of moral
3,were going to come back to that
3,lack all conviction while the worst are
3,groupings we would crush them so we
3,things in the world to come to
3,the particular circumstances of time and place
3,to come back to that in a
3,to men how little they know about
3,a lot of people thought it would
3,federal home loan bank of san francisco
3,there are a lot of different ways
3,rules of the extended order to our
3,i think there is a lot of
3,not fool yourself and you are the
3,one of the things i think is
3,to live in a world where its
3,steal a euro from an old lady
3,our present difficulty is that we must
3,a little learning is a dangerous thing
3,its not obvious to me that the
3,i think there is no doubt that
3,of the 18th century and put him
3,the microcosmos ie of the small band
3,talked about this before on the program
3,like to give money to their friends
3,the causal effect of winning the lottery
3,is to illustrate to men how little
3,live in two sorts of world at
3,figure out what to do with it
3,more valuable than they used to be
3,thats the right way to think about
3,what i talk about in the book
3,dont have a very good understanding of
3,russ do you want to say anything
3,say we just need to spend more
3,of the extended order to our more
3,let me ask it a different way
3,the library of economics and liberty website
3,one of the cruelest things in the
3,to the rest of the world and
3,a group of people set their hearts
3,but if you go back to the
3,im going to reduce my risk of
3,have a lot of political power in
3,yet if we were always to apply
3,we were on the edge of a
3,pay a lot of attention to it
3,we must learn to live in two
3,to sell it at the market price
3,the way i think about it is
3,you are not going to be able
3,i dont know if im going to
3,order to our more intimate groupings we
3,give money to their friends they just
3,talk a lot on this program about
3,i dont have to give you any
3,cruelest things in the world to come
3,know how to do it very well
3,dont pay a lot of attention to
3,hundreds of millions of people in the
3,the best thing that ever happened to
3,in the middle of the street and
3,and then i want to move on
3,russ so let me ask you a
3,theory of moral sentiments by adam smith
3,present difficulty is that we must constantly
3,if you are trying to figure out
3,social science and we are its practitioners
3,and at the end of the day
3,you are the kind of person who
3,in the case of the soviet union
3,and i dont think we have a
3,are sitting on a lot of cash
3,so we must learn to live in
3,talk about what you mean by that
3,if we were always to apply the
3,i have talked about this before on
3,of the cruelest things in the world
3,i think we are going to see
3,agree with you in the sense that
3,and sentimental yearnings often make us wish
3,examples that you give in the book
3,at the end of the day the
3,to make as much money as possible
3,i want you to talk about what
3,our more intimate groupings we would crush
3,for a whole bunch of reasons but
3,what we really want to do is
3,to give money to their friends they
3,the world to come to a group
3,would go so far as to say
3,russ i couldnt agree with you more
3,must learn to live in two sorts
3,its the right thing to do and
3,and we are not going to be
3,they are going to go out of
3,what you try to do is to
3,i dont disagree with that at all
3,make us wish to do we would
3,of them will have to do with
3,friends they just have different friends but
3,one of the things i like to
3,i dont spend a lot of time
3,dont have prices for factors of production
3,all their money back 100 cents on
3,said theres a lot of ruin in
3,spend a lot of time talking about
3,one way to do that is to
3,the amount of rain thats fallen since
3,there are a lot of ways to
3,more intimate groupings we would crush them
3,that china is going to get ahead
3,our thoughts and our emotions in order
3,to live in two sorts of world
3,there are a lot of differences between
3,and i think thats one of the
3,to their friends they just have different
3,you are going to have to answer
3,of what we might think of as
3,i dont think we have a very
3,need to go back and figure out
3,are more valuable than they used to
3,theres a lot of things going on
3,one of the themes of the book
3,that inflation is always and everywhere a
3,if you take a look at the
3,at the u of alabama in huntsville
3,are going to talk about today is
3,to the macrocosmos our wider civilisation as
3,you get to a point where you
3,a monetary history of the united states
3,one of the themes of your book
3,if the government increases its spending by
3,want to make sure i understand the
3,you and i have talked about this
3,if you think about it there are
3,of how to get the most out
3,and you spend a lot of time
3,how little they know about what they
3,the question is what do you do
3,im going to put you in charge
3,something that cant go on forever wont
3,do you think we ought to be
3,you are on the left or the
3,organization for economic cooperation and development oecd
3,the united states and the united kingdom
3,and there are a lot of different
3,the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis
3,i think there are two things that
3,all conviction while the worst are full
3,it took me a long time to
3,you point out in the book a
3,whatever you want to call it and
3,of the small band or troop or
3,and so as a consequence they are
3,we were going to run out of
3,do you think of that guest i
3,rules if we were to apply the
3,their money back 100 cents on the
3,on the library of economics and liberty
3,the vast majority of our jobs are
3,smith in the theory of moral sentiments
3,i think there are some people who
3,is the study of how to get
2,you have to find a solution to
2,at a time when the economy is
2,around to a bunch of people and
2,theres a lot of evidence that the
2,if we are ever going to get
2,which every human being has of a
2,would not be able to do that
2,weve talked about a number of times
2,about what would you do if you
2,cost and in the case of the
2,a lot of people are worried about
2,to fight your way to the top
2,well talk about that in a minute
2,going to come back and talk about
2,at a point in time if you
2,skin in the game and of course
2,one of the things that people dont
2,change your life theres magic comingits the
2,was at the height of the financial
2,but i think if you are a
2,spend a lot of money on these
2,that but i think its important to
2,the taxpayers who pay it in the
2,and there are a couple of things
2,so we are really talking about a
2,the people who ran the library in
2,that we have in the united states
2,get fired in the public school system
2,that i think one of the things
2,happened over the course of the last
2,the theory of moral sentiments adam smith
2,are going to spend a lot of
2,in the hundreds of billions of dollars
2,so another way to say it is
2,about what it takes to be a
2,a very big incentive to roll out
2,took for granted that a large sheepskin
2,to laertes neither a borrower nor a
2,but if it happens its going to
2,what you are saying and i agree
2,high school math teacher and i think
2,think we care a lot about our
2,in the late 1920s and early 1930s
2,in terms of fiscal policy did little
2,is an occupation where some people are
2,what was your point there guest well
2,depended on how close you were to
2,dont think you talk about in the
2,of what you are talking about is
2,if you are the ceo of a
2,for what is sublime and elegant in
2,will ask the builder to cut corners
2,and then we are going to have
2,intro recording date january 16 2014 russ
2,due to the fact that we subsidize
2,its going to look like you started
2,an undergraduate and as a graduate student
2,idea that you have to have a
2,but i think youre right i think
2,and of course there are a lot
2,bit to the left of the house
2,good way to think about it so
2,a lot of the people who are
2,have a lot of interesting things to
2,costs of moving in and out of
2,looked at the money sent to the
2,be so arrogant to think that you
2,the cool thing about google is that
2,dont want to be ruled by the
2,say our families to the macrocosmos our
2,and at the beginning of the year
2,few of us take the job that
2,a billion dollars to create a new
2,were going to come back to the
2,why the fed is paying interest on
2,had played by the rules of capitalism
2,a lot of money into the banking
2,guest well i think thats right i
2,push back a little bit which is
2,i think is at least part of
2,know what they are going to do
2,happened on piper alpha the more i
2,that theres going to be this cascade
2,sell it for 20 shillings a bushel
2,to buy but if they dont have
2,between 1930 and 1933 the monetary base
2,is how much should i charge for
2,to the behavior of the money supply
2,heres what is relevant if memphis wants
2,the question is whats the best way
2,being has of a better life especially
2,say its okay to steal car radios
2,chuck williams dean of butler universitys college
2,dont want to go down that road
2,do i need to know about hume
2,want to put in a plug for
2,how do you keep that from happening
2,yet in many waysand you concede that
2,but one of the things that i
2,in the new england journal of medicine
2,common which is the financial sector and
2,orders according to different rules if we
2,even if you dont believe in it
2,look like the students who go to
2,i think theres a lot of that
2,there are a number of problems with
2,thatching a roof or butchering a goat
2,to say its okay to steal car
2,were going to wind up with a
2,of the things that we have seen
2,russ so im sympathetic to that view
2,take the other side of the bet
2,of the federal reserve bank of new
2,and so on but i dont think
2,or it could be that the stimulus
2,working for them 5 years from now

2,wages go up by a factor of
2,want to be part of a community
2,and one of the things that we

2,the rules of the game of banking
2,i talk about this in the book
2,stylist who has been in the business
2,corners otherwise they cant afford the house

2,that you are unable to engage in
2,a hell of a lot more leisure
2,that would be an interesting thing to
2,part of what jeffrey sachs does that
2,you are going to have problems with
2,do this for the whole country and
2,are the product of human action but
2,want to go back to the builder
2,i dont know if you want to
2,will be done who will work how
2,designed for liberty private property public administration
2,how to get from a to b
2,of whats going on russ yeah i
2,2013 russ were going to talk today
2,households that are headed by someone 65
2,by the way we havent talked about
2,in todays dollars when they are fully
2,who are best able to determine how
2,everyone took for granted that a large
2,paid a lot they arent any more
2,becomes the defender of misess position on
2,guest well one of the things that
2,then i had a 2year postdoc at
2,one of the driving forces behind that
2,1982 with the tax equity and fiscal
2,to smash it and through your own
2,your thoughts on where we are heading
2,i want to bring it to the
2,students who go to the ivy league
2,russ were going to talk about your
2,to bring it there in the first
2,now lets put that to the side
2,lying around the house all day long
2,wouldnt want to argue that population growth
2,and maybe well come back and talk
2,worry about the value of their investments
2,of the economic way of thinking to
2,they look like the students who go
2,what the government is going to do
2,about these fields yourself and that is
2,we were going to do the census
2,becoming incredibly knowledgeable about these fields yourself
2,be the cheapest way to cope with
2,per capita i dont have the exact
2,i want to go back to your
2,to find a solution to that and
2,to claim that you can make things
2,is smaller than it used to be
2,and we are going to talk about
2,dont have time to look at every
2,im going to read a very short
2,100 of children will be proficient by
2,that a good thing or a bad
2,encourage people to stay in high school
2,there was a lot of uncertainty about
2,do you think of that argument well
2,own hubrisit just its so depressing partly
2,dont want to suggest that this is
2,hasnt been transformed in the way that
2,to go back to the kind of
2,i know many people over the age
2,as competition arises from overseas the division
2,on a case by case basis and
2,the most disadvantaged segments of the population
2,fit in with the rest of the
2,in this book is to say that
2,is left for parents to be increasing
2,chaired by the secretary of the treasury
2,free market interest rate will tend to
2,people enough you are not going to
2,who do the work it can be
2,of the last 30 years has been
2,want to come back to this issue
2,have a lot more to talk about
2,where do you think we ought to
2,a 1 percentage point increase in growth
2,nations or the theory of moral sentiments
2,go back to something you said a
2,what are some of the things you
2,called economic calculation in the socialist commonwealth
2,if you are going to have a
2,russ our topic today is your book
2,dont necessarily take the job that pays
2,to be honest about what its doing
2,doubled the number of students graduating in
2,the number of hours in a day
2,about a lot of things but the
2,in the 100 losers you are a
2,the nominal price of gold is fixed
2,that the manufacturing sector in the united
2,of the total amount of the money
2,it would be a mistake to think
2,the same thing at the same time
2,its efficient given that you dont know
2,adam smith the theory of moral sentiments
2,the rules of the game are going
2,law that abridges the privileges or immunities
2,you want to say anything about the
2,russ that was my next question guest
2,going to pay a price for that
2,public services are going to get squeezed
2,in the runup to the great depression
2,and if what you want to do
2,we have to turn to government spending
2,google and you invest in the 100
2,if you have low skill and you
2,in substantial gainful activity in the us
2,there are lots of different ways to
2,inconsistent with saying the fed did too
2,the president of the united states is
2,a bad draw out of the urn
2,a statement about the limits of reason
2,and then at the end of the
2,china was a bunch of women with
2,lay down for what is sublime and
2,i have other things i want to
2,but before i do i want to
2,and the people at the upper end
2,economy is growing too quickly the fed
2,prices at the end of the 1970s
2,federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic
2,taxpayers and recipients of public services are
2,of what was going on in the
2,up a lot of room in your
2,in the united states i think most
2,and well come back to this later
2,the united states in the last 40
2,in the long run were all dead
2,ought to be trying to fix the
2,shift gears i want to talk about
2,it seems to me that we are
2,do you think about that guest well
2,enough you are not going to get
2,a lot of noise in the data
2,of a better life especially for their
2,and then on top of that we
2,these are restricted for this reason and
2,in the 1970s and 1980s but in
2,the result of human action but not
2,well have a chance to talk about
2,let me give you an example and
2,the only way im going to get
2,and what are we going to do
2,and to take that dream which every
2,are you going to pay it in
2,but if they dont have it when
2,i dont think you talk about in
2,questions and involves becoming incredibly knowledgeable about
2,a bad quarter or a bad year
2,and so on and i think the
2,spend a lot of time fascinated by
2,so lets take a couple of examples
2,earth been divided into equal portions among
2,society and the state are different things
2,one person who came from the private
2,basic principle of banking which is know
2,before introducing todays guest i want to
2,at the end of the day im
2,it harder for other people to play
2,and it has nothing to do with
2,else you want to add guest well
2,a large part of the 1 they
2,a lot of people think this is
2,a long way to go and its
2,all your eggs in one basket and
2,discount rate that we would apply to
2,that the central bank should try to
2,there are people who make a living
2,we dont ever want a store to
2,that the right thing to do is
2,you dont know what youre talking about
2,important strand of libertarianism that is very
2,difference between the 90th percentile and the
2,so talk about that a little bit
2,willing to use the power of the
2,is there are two ways to get
2,people running the system of the antitrust
2,we need to make sure we are
2,video called the fight of the century
2,that we dont know what would have
2,he didnt want to climb the ladder
2,of whats happening on the ground and
2,to think about what would you do
2,they were the first ones to send
2,but i want to talk first about
2,a lot of people would disagree with
2,the united states over the last 30
2,the front page of the new york
2,curious what you think is going to
2,in college to think otherwise is the
2,russ and you talk in the book
2,children and to smash it and through
2,that space between the individual and the
2,moneyand your lives are going to be
2,how do you decide how much to
2,weve talked about before on this program
2,point which you make in the book
2,it on the other side of the
2,im not sure how important it is
2,we are not going to have the
2,its very difficult to make the case
2,the fifth book of the wealth of
2,the rest of the economy but that
2,russ so where does that leave us
2,so there are a lot of things
2,going to be different and to take
2,and i think we are going to
2,of bank failures with lots of losses
2,and there are going to be a
2,stock price goes up i make money
2,on this program a few episodes back
2,make a lot of money which is
2,the test group and the control group
2,and i dont know what the answer
2,division of labor being limited by the
2,can make a lot of money and
2,off point we are going to use
2,let me give you an example of
2,have to be really bored to go
2,at the end of the day its
2,less than 100 cents on the dollar
2,you think thats a good choice the
2,and they didnt put it back into
2,at the end of the day they
2,adam smith said theres a lot of
2,a world where its okay to steal
2,with somebody with whom you disagree and
2,monetary history of the united states 18671960
2,but a lot of it really is
