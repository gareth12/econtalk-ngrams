1,real or is it just a matter of emphasis what are the
1,but bankers once they are insuredwhen they increase their leverage they dont
1,very effective system it seems to me and so while you can
1,its therefore authoritariani think if i may say so misunderstands the goal
1,really lead to crises of confidence financial markets they dont see an
1,rigor that are there the other point is that we have had
1,the least advantaged in society taken care of and what the rent
1,things for us and doing things for other people working for each
1,experiment in the use of incentives before they were paid by the
1,your words otherwise you just get a letter salad that cant be

1,and baked the bread and went home and then they had a
1,absolutely if you want to give to say alzheimers research and you
1,that they impose even stricter restrictions on whats going on so the
1,to make one important point there really is in a model where
1,analysis that made it more likely to get a result that looked
1,that especially seems to be the case at the very top so
1,athletes and bill james says why is that and he pointed out
1,what motivates us im with you on that and the question is
1,with at least for some time especially at the k12 level i
1,drowning in toilet bowls than from terrorist attacks with the one exception
1,was how hightech it has become in our minds making potato chips
1,to do like going fastrun on privatization we could not manage so
1,fact that this financial system involved a lot of ious and because
1,things that you think you did i just assumed that it was
1,from economic tools 2307 cults nonmainstream groups popular perception jonestown being abducted
1,with you no one wants a system where people who are low
1,thing the striking fact is the lack of learning in settings where
1,perhaps the average person doesnt get quite as much fun as we
1,you happier justin and i finally documented this in a paper that
1,it seems to me the demand in the economy is low compared
1,better place totally different approach standalone charging stations or swap batteries lots
1,that number rises by threefold thats what i mean by financial deepening
1,because the president of the united states is responsible for the safety
1,reporting led to one of my favorite interviews in the book which
1,so i went to themi saidi realized that i am rentcontrolled so
1,but merely respond to the incentive seems to be a waste oneperson
1,never happened why should government have any role we dont tell car
1,there that lawyers are earning morewe call it an earnings premium because
1,coddled and rescued from their own folly by the government perfect fit
1,the more i went into schools the more i realized that there
1,being very low risk and so the investment banks were able to
1,clear as anybody can see one has to be aware of this
1,dont do this dont do that and you are also negotiating you
1,been part of the labor force and that is about 98 of
1,hundreds of pages of documents released by the financial inquiry commission what
1,gouging and the minimum wagethey are both phenomena where the price thats
1,define the right keywords russ do you think thats a real phenomenon

1,surface that is being fed by the fed the rates and stuff
1,we loved from your lesson and we thought were just great you
1,tanks can be kind of hackish but may agree with the punchline
1,is this is a market in which if you stand still you

1,course but thats why its interesting i think we have such a
1,resistance of elevated insulin levels and obese individuals turn out to be
1,to destroying the whole world i mean the economic world does run
1,they are behind everything that they are trying to repair on the
1,has largely disappeared by the 1920s the labor market was competitive enough
