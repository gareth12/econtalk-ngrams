191,there are a lot of
142,one of the things that
117,if you look at the
116,at the end of the
87,in the united states and
76,i think a lot of
75,the rest of the world
72,there is a lot of
70,you are not going to
67,are going to have to
66,they are not going to
61,one of the things i
60,you are going to have
60,going to be able to
59,if you are going to
55,i think one of the
51,we are going to have
51,but at the same time
51,and one of the things
50,you are going to be
50,a lot of people who
47,they are going to be
47,when you look at the
47,spend a lot of time
47,the end of the day
45,it seems to me that
43,what are some of the
43,in the middle of the
42,in the united states in
40,are not going to be
40,you point out in the
40,way to think about it
40,the theory of moral sentiments
39,that we are going to
39,if you go back to
39,you are going to get
38,in the case of the
38,we are not going to
38,i want to start with
37,in the united states is
37,has nothing to do with
36,as you point out in
36,to the rest of the
36,think a lot of people
36,and as you point out
36,there was a lot of
36,i want to talk about
35,what we are talking about
35,they are going to have
35,is going to be a
34,point out in the book
34,that you are going to
34,what do you think of
34,this is one of the
33,100 cents on the dollar
33,what do you mean by
33,at the beginning of the
32,here in the united states
32,a little bit of a
32,what are your thoughts on
32,there are going to be
31,and you are going to
30,every once in a while
29,there are a number of
29,want to come back to
29,talk about in the book
29,make a lot of money
29,you have a lot of
29,we are going to get
29,so one of the things
29,on the other side of
29,are going to have a
29,is not going to be
29,we have a lot of
29,and i think thats a
28,that a lot of people
28,you go back to the
28,is that a lot of
28,and we are going to
28,to go back to the
28,i think there is a
28,but as you point out
28,in the united states we
28,the other side of the
28,one of the things you
27,that a lot of the
27,use of knowledge in society
27,our topic for today is
27,if we are going to
27,nothing to do with the
27,dont have to worry about
27,there were a lot of
26,are a lot of people
26,there are a couple of
26,in the book is that
26,talk about some of the
26,i want to come back
26,at a point in time
26,and i think this is
26,but on the other hand
25,the united states in the
25,i think its important to
25,the rest of the economy
25,the rules of the game
25,and all of a sudden
25,that they are going to
25,a lot of people are
25,we are going to be
25,what do you think is
25,the right thing to do
24,and so on and so
24,to figure out how to
24,they are going to get
24,one of the things we
24,in the united states that
24,one of the things thats
24,so on and so forth
24,but if you look at
24,by the end of the
24,want to go back to
24,the world a better place
23,and a lot of people
23,are not going to get
23,a long period of time
23,a lot of people have
23,a lot of it is
23,there is going to be
23,a lot of money and
23,in the rest of the
23,and if you look at
23,but one of the things
23,i want to ask you
23,have to be able to
23,to be able to do
22,live in a world where
22,a lot of what we
22,what do we know about
22,those of us who are
22,were going to talk about
22,and they are going to
22,so if you look at
22,do you think of that
22,are not going to have
22,let me ask you a
21,i think theres a lot
21,have to look at the
21,in the last 20 years
21,are going to get a
21,what we are going to
21,i think it would be
21,we are going to do
21,i just want to mention
21,if you want to get
21,i agree with you that
21,russ so lets talk about
21,going to be a lot
21,in the united states the
21,i dont know what the
20,a lot of people would
20,you are talking about the
20,i want to go back
20,on the part of the
20,i think you are right
20,russ let me ask you
20,well come back to that
20,i think there are a
20,we are going to talk
20,over the last 30 years
20,people who are going to
20,not going to be able
20,fannie mae and freddie mac
20,what you are talking about
20,and at the same time
20,its not going to be
19,it doesnt have to be
19,are going to talk about
19,put that to the side
19,do we know anything about
19,put a link up to
19,whats going on in the
19,russ lets talk about the
19,to find a way to
19,i think there are some
19,one of the problems with
19,in the united states but
19,theres going to be a
19,russ our topic for today
19,and i think its a
19,are a lot of things
19,they are going to do
19,that if you look at
19,in the 1950s and 1960s
19,but a lot of people
19,have nothing to do with
19,is that there is a
19,the left and the right
19,i think there are two
19,to be a lot of
19,history of the united states
19,in the aftermath of the
18,if you think about the
18,this is going to be
18,you talk about in the
18,you want to say anything
18,he had a lot of
18,you want to call it
18,are your thoughts on that
18,it turns out to be
18,one way to think about
18,its going to be a
18,you have to look at
18,the economy as a whole
18,for a variety of reasons
18,the point of view of
17,that was one of the
17,of the people who are
17,whatever you want to call
17,we are talking about the
17,has to do with the
17,a lot of people in
17,the earned income tax credit
17,talk a little bit about
17,that if you want to
17,i think it was a
17,i dont think its a
17,in the united states russ
17,in the 1980s and 1990s
17,spent a lot of time
17,what we need to do
17,that if you have a
17,and i dont want to
17,what you are saying is
17,a lot to do with
17,the number of people who
17,think of it as a
17,they are the ones who
17,the use of knowledge in
17,what you want to do
17,russ lets move on to
17,theres no such thing as
17,think theres a lot of
17,guest well first of all
17,in the last few years
17,when you are talking about
17,over the last 50 years
17,let me give you a
16,dont have a lot of
16,a lot of people think
16,in the united states are
16,thats one of the things
16,as far as i can
16,do you mean by that
16,had nothing to do with
16,i think part of the
16,thats part of the reason
16,at the u of chicago
16,you have to do is
16,the fact that they are
16,to be a little bit
16,and thats one of the
16,have skin in the game
16,do you want to say
16,at the same time the
16,that one of the things
16,when you think about it
16,think thats part of the
16,and so i think that
16,monetary history of the united
16,we dont know how to
16,to be one of the
16,the savings and loan crisis
16,in the sense that they
16,to come up with a
16,to get rid of the
16,i dont know if you
16,and im not going to
15,is going to be the
15,in the united states its
15,the end of his life
15,if you think about it
15,is one of the things
15,over the course of the
15,for a very long time
15,the house and the senate
15,that are going to be
15,let me give you an
15,you think is going to
15,the fact that there are
15,one of the reasons that
15,im going to give you
15,they have a lot of
15,at the same time i
15,i think that would be
15,i think thats a very
15,on the one hand and
15,a little bit about the
15,and what do you think
15,were going to have to
15,to do the right thing
15,i dont think there is
15,a lender of last resort
15,a bunch of people who
15,make the world a better
15,if we look at the
15,that turned out to be
15,want to be able to
15,in a lot of ways
15,a couple of years ago
15,a lot of things that
15,one of the themes of
15,it could be that the
15,way to think about this
15,but it seems to me
15,in the 1960s and 1970s
15,and theres a lot of
15,to have a lot of
15,from the point of view
15,want to talk about the
15,think one of the things
15,i think its a very
15,that we are talking about
15,and there are a lot
15,way to say it is
15,if you are in the
15,you have to have a
15,if you are trying to
14,of the things that i
14,i dont know if thats
14,a lot of time on
14,are a lot of different
14,i think this is a
14,than it used to be
14,lets go back to the
14,are going to be able
14,want to live in a
14,at any point in time
14,and i agree with you
14,there are all kinds of
14,in the middle of a
14,i think thats part of
14,so you are going to
14,what they are doing is
14,they imagine they can design
14,what do you think the
14,the united states and the
14,in the 1970s and 1980s
14,about what they imagine they
14,have anything to do with
14,in the same way that
14,so if you want to
14,at the same time and
14,over the last 20 years
14,we have to do is
14,you want to talk about
14,for a lot of people
14,the nature of the firm
14,you are going to do
14,when you are in a
14,and when you look at
14,it has to do with
14,a little bit of the
14,which i think is a
14,to make a lot of
14,people on the other side
14,the economic way of thinking
14,hundreds of billions of dollars
14,what they imagine they can
13,a whole bunch of reasons
13,but there are a lot
13,one of the challenges of
13,might not be able to
13,what do you think about
13,what are you going to
13,a lot of them are
13,but the point is that
13,so i think that the
13,by the extent of the
13,we need to do is
13,the curious task of economics
13,and it turns out that
13,where do you think we
13,curious task of economics is
13,to get out of the
13,me give you an example
13,what i would call the
13,part of the reason that
13,i dont want to be
13,think they are going to
13,the kind of thing that
13,may not be able to
13,so if you are a
13,there are all sorts of
13,of the wealth of nations
13,have a little bit of
13,trying to figure out what
13,hundreds of millions of dollars
13,that there are a lot
13,the state of the economy
13,so i think there are
13,if you look at a
13,on both sides of the
13,in such a way that
13,on the other hand if
13,there are people who are
13,in the united states which
13,what we think of as
13,i think we have to
13,you are going to make
13,in the united states so
13,at the top of the
13,if you look at what
13,russ so i want to
13,because they are going to
13,and i think a lot
13,in the late 19th century
13,going to have to be
13,im a big fan of
13,trying to figure out how
13,a lot of evidence that
13,what you do is you
13,the london school of economics
13,the way the world works
13,and i think thats the
13,a lot of the time
13,and it seems to me
13,task of economics is to
13,about in the book is
13,for a whole bunch of
13,the end of the book
13,in the last 10 years
13,and one of the reasons
13,the problem with that is
13,are more likely to be
13,i think its going to
13,that theres going to be
13,there is no doubt that
13,what that means is that
13,on the other hand i
12,if you are looking at
12,that you are talking about
12,i dont think we have
12,to do a lot of
12,we get there from here
12,a big part of the
12,one of the reasons why
12,in the last 30 years
12,part of the 20th century
12,far as i can tell
12,think we are going to
12,when you are looking at
12,guest well i think that
12,the fact that we are
12,have to pay for it
12,and so one of the
12,to be able to get
12,i dont think they are
12,as far as i know
12,you are talking about a
12,is one of the most
12,if you are in a
12,the congressional budget office cbo
12,think there are a lot
12,which is one of the
12,it seems to me the
12,out of the labor force
12,and i think one of
12,made a lot of money
12,russ i agree with that
12,one way or the other
12,what they are going to
12,the early part of the
12,all you have to do
12,there are a bunch of
12,limited by the extent of
12,we are talking about here
12,it was supposed to be
12,people in the united states
12,in all kinds of ways
12,seems like a good thing
12,but a lot of the
12,are trying to figure out
12,to make sure that the
12,you want to look at
12,you want to have a
12,to take advantage of the
12,there are some people who
12,but if you want to
12,in the united states today
12,to spend a lot of
12,is that if you are
12,right way to think about
12,but i think its a
12,as a result of that
12,going to come back to
12,from the rest of the
12,do you think is going
12,of the rest of the
12,i dont think theres any
12,of the things that we
12,but at the end of
12,in the hands of the
12,so when you look at
12,so theres a lot of
12,one of the reasons i
12,troubled asset relief program tarp
12,but i think a lot
12,talk about this in the
12,of the things that is
12,that there is a lot
12,is part of the problem
12,it in a way that
12,whats your reaction to that
12,russ what do you think
12,the federal deposit insurance corporation
12,i think thats a good
12,i dont know if its
12,to men how little they
12,to come back to that
12,know about what they imagine
12,what does it mean to
12,not a big fan of
12,you are trying to do
12,one of the things he
12,to do something about it
12,the extent of the market
12,i think we need to
12,and some of them are
12,library of economics and liberty
12,the library of economics and
11,to think of it as
11,know how to do that
11,the end of the year
11,i just want to say
11,to live in a world
11,in the wake of the
11,a lot of people argue
11,2013 russ our topic for
11,seems to me that the
11,of economics is to demonstrate
11,are much more likely to
11,if you want to know
11,he was one of the
11,the united states i think
11,is that one of the
11,is one of the great
11,one of the things they
11,the value of the dollar
11,i dont think it was
11,in the early part of
11,i dont know how to
11,you want to do is
11,to a lot of people
11,well put a link up
11,i agree with you i
11,an enormous amount of money
11,what you have to do
11,the power of the state
11,are going to be the
11,if you want to have
11,we live in a world
11,in the history of the
11,in the wealth of nations
11,want to ask you about
11,there are two things that
11,in the united states it
11,to try to figure out
11,but when it comes to
11,i dont think we can
11,to get back to the
11,a lot of people say
11,a lot of money to
11,we are talking about is
11,was going to be a
11,to figure out what the
11,what im saying is that
11,lets talk a little bit
11,so i dont want to
11,in the back of the
11,in the united states guest
11,who is going to be
11,the right way to think
11,and i have to say
11,im going to have to
11,the government is going to
11,i dont think you can
11,lot of people would say
11,way to do that is
11,are going to be a
11,the people who are in
11,what is the role of
11,about what you mean by
11,what you are doing is
11,in the united states you
11,a year and a half
11,relative to the rest of
11,the united states and in
11,a lot of people dont
11,you dont want to be
11,i was going to say
11,they dont want to be
11,and i think that is
11,all of a sudden you
11,its one thing to say
11,at the time of the
11,they are more likely to
11,freddie mac and fannie mae
11,the way the world is
11,a lot of money but
11,thats part of the problem
11,what you are trying to
11,other parts of the world
11,has something to do with
11,and so you have to
11,do you think we are
10,have to worry about the
10,to come back to the
10,guest well i think the
10,be able to do that
10,as you point out its
10,division of labor is limited
10,making a lot of money
10,what was going on in
10,you are suggesting that the
10,if it turns out that
10,not going to be a
10,what are we going to
10,are going to get the
10,the average level of prices
10,in the interest of the
10,that the best way to
10,but we are going to
10,no such thing as a
10,know what they are doing
10,lets talk about some of
10,have to think about it
10,for those of us who
10,increase in the money supply
10,why dont you talk about
10,always and everywhere a monetary
10,we spend a lot of
10,but i think it was
10,of the things that you
10,is limited by the extent
10,i certainly agree with you
10,that has to do with
10,going to be in the
10,point i want to make
10,it turns out that the
10,the last couple of years
10,one of the most interesting
10,dont think there is any
10,lot of people argue that
10,go back and look at
10,how hard it is to
10,talk about what you mean
10,in the united states as
10,labor is limited by the
10,as a share of gdp
10,federal deposit insurance corporation fdic
10,over a long period of
10,they would be able to
10,increase in the number of
10,but i dont think we
10,not going to be very
10,going to have to make
10,at the time it was
10,the bureau of labor statistics
10,on the other hand it
10,to think about it is
10,guest yeah i think thats
10,a whole bunch of people
10,think that would be a
10,for a long time and
10,in other parts of the
10,so it seems to me
10,i think the problem is
10,the tragedy of the commons
10,president of the united states
10,going to be talking about
10,are you going to do
10,thats the kind of thing
10,how are we going to
10,so let me give you
10,but i dont think it
10,and i dont know what
10,have been a lot of
10,of labor is limited by
10,and everywhere a monetary phenomenon
10,think its going to be
10,are going to be very
10,you take a look at
10,that in the short run
10,you dont have to worry
10,problem with that is that
10,a little more complicated than
10,not going to give you
10,why do you think that
10,the number of people in
10,in the united states has
10,and i think that the
10,back to the 19th century
10,know how to do it
10,for a couple of years
10,if you look at it
10,i want to close with
10,but i just want to
10,one of the things about
10,and thats going to be
10,the problem of social cost
10,that is going to be
10,we are talking about a
10,the beginning of the book
10,economics is to demonstrate to
10,if we go back to
10,and i think there are
10,its going to be very
10,whats your take on that
10,to do the same thing
10,want to start with the
10,they are going to go
10,dont know how to do
10,lets put that to the
10,so i think there is
10,in the wall street journal
10,to take care of the
10,i want to try to
10,than they used to be
10,in the united states to
10,russ i want to go
10,the size of the pie
10,one of the most important
10,what the market will bear
10,is going to be very
10,the secretary of the treasury
10,you get a lot of
10,are going to end up
10,russ i just want to
10,if you dont have a
10,in the book which is
9,certainly agree with you that
9,if you are worried about
9,and i want to start
9,the best way to do
9,a link up to it
9,has been a lot of
9,they were going to be
9,of too big to fail
9,theres been a lot of
9,to the extent that the
9,are going to have the
9,if you are not careful
9,going to give you a
9,you want to think about
9,in a way that is
9,and its going to be
9,from the rest of us
9,the way in which the
9,to demonstrate to men how
9,in the united states there
9,theory of money and credit
9,where they are going to
9,the united states is that
9,in the united states than
9,the united states has a
9,over the course of a
9,and i think theres a
9,a guest on this program
9,we owe it to ourselves
9,when you talk about the
9,you dont have to go
9,and i want you to
9,a lot of money on
9,to do with the fact
9,its not obvious to me
9,think there are two things
9,of the united states and
9,you have to think about
9,think a lot of the
9,you are going to find
9,when we talk about the
9,that has nothing to do
9,have to find a way
9,i think most people would
9,on the other hand there
9,the lender of last resort
9,the world would be a
9,in the united states was
9,when you go to the
9,the first part of the
9,which is a little bit
9,in the united states they
9,are going to have an
9,food and drug administration fda
9,a large number of people
9,i think it is a
9,for the economy as a
9,you have to do it
9,in the united states over
9,you are not allowed to
9,is not the same as
9,for a long long time
9,of what they are doing
9,that have nothing to do
9,a lot of uncertainty about
9,a lot of people that
9,and at the end of
9,so they are going to
9,because they dont want to
9,dont spend a lot of
9,we dont have to worry
9,to the end of the
9,to think about it in
9,but most of the time
9,is to demonstrate to men
9,the division of labor is
9,you talk in the book
9,we have to look at
9,at the same time as
9,changes in the money supply
9,and you dont have to
9,spend a lot of money
9,the way we think about
9,have to do is to
9,thats the right way to
9,and part of the reason
9,as to whether or not
9,i think the answer is
9,is always going to be
9,but i do think that
9,are we going to do
9,let me ask you about
9,in the united states i
9,so we are going to
9,then all of a sudden
9,what are they going to
9,the best thing to do
9,than in the united states
9,in the runup to the
9,have a lot of people
9,one of the interesting things
9,as a result of the
9,are going to make a
9,that you dont want to
9,i say in the book
9,that have to do with
9,would be a good thing
9,a lot of people will
9,the fact that we have
9,have something to do with
9,it was going to be
9,from the perspective of the
9,bank of the united states
9,number of people who are
9,of the nature of the
9,the united states and europe
9,at the bottom of the
9,which is going to be
9,rest of the world and
9,are going to be in
9,a lot of attention to
9,but i dont think its
9,when you are trying to
9,and so i think the
9,i think you have to
9,in the fall of 2008
9,in ways that are not
9,thats going to be a
9,to be a little more
9,have to worry about that
9,guest yeah i think that
9,and why do you think
9,on the left and the
9,is one of the reasons
9,its just a question of
9,the ability of people to
9,i dont think it would
9,guest i think thats right
9,and the reason for that
9,are a lot of reasons
9,you are more likely to
9,and the rest of the
9,you are going to see
9,demonstrate to men how little
9,really know about what they
9,of what we are doing
9,they are not in the
9,part of the reason is
9,what we are trying to
9,as you point out there
9,think you are going to
9,of looking at the world
9,and i dont think we
9,something to do with the
9,in the sense that the
9,bureau of labor statistics bls
9,in the last 5 years
9,what you need to do
9,in the last 25 years
9,we are not talking about
9,problem in the united states
9,the great depression and the
9,and a lot of the
9,a little bit in the
9,to make the case that
9,all the way to the
9,figure out a way to
9,to do a good job
9,you have to worry about
9,for economic cooperation and development
9,the problem i have with
9,its a little bit of
9,you talk about this in
9,the securities and exchange commission
9,and of course there are
9,say we are going to
9,russ were going to talk
9,are in the middle of
8,i dont know if they
8,in a world where we
8,turned out not to be
8,turned out to be a
8,inflation is always and everywhere
8,not going to have any
8,want to say anything else
8,is if you want to
8,new england journal of medicine
8,i think thats a huge
8,they really know about what
8,of the things i think
8,at the height of the
8,of whats going on in
8,we ought to be doing
8,in the early 20th century
8,all the way back to
8,that we dont have a
8,do you mean by the
8,what i mean by that
8,and if you want to
8,want to be in the
8,are the people who are
8,banks in the united states
8,i know a lot of
8,and in the case of
8,not obvious to me that
8,russ i want to come
8,if you go back and
8,the international monetary fund imf
8,that if you are going
8,are a couple of things
8,if you think of the
8,if you want to be
8,do we get there from
8,there is a sort of
8,in order to do that
8,off the top of my
8,it has a lot of
8,i do think theres a
8,it in the united states
8,i want to turn to
8,is always and everywhere a
8,because a lot of the
8,and i think we should
8,a lot of time and
8,there has been a lot
8,the rate of time preference
8,what weve been talking about
8,at a time when the
8,topic for today is the
8,the top of my head
8,best way to do it
8,in the sense that we
8,thing to keep in mind
8,one of the reasons we
8,if you dont do that
8,in the sense that he
8,command over goods and services
8,dont want to have to
8,be able to do it
8,its just a matter of
8,at the expense of the
8,is going to be able
8,a matter of time before
8,so there are a lot
8,seems to me to be
8,part of the problem is
8,in the absence of the
8,you see a lot of
8,the value of the yuan
8,russ lets go back to
8,for a long period of
8,its going to be an
8,i dont disagree with that
8,dont know if thats true
8,in the sense that its
8,and the fact that we
8,the fact of the matter
8,in the middle of nowhere
8,the reason for that is
8,you dont have to have
8,you come up with a
8,what you end up with
8,i think this is where
8,i talk about in the
8,a lot of money into
8,russ well lets talk about
8,and then i want to
8,we are all going to
8,what is going on in
8,it was one of the
8,people are going to be
8,is a little bit of
8,in the united states if
8,in a way that you
8,there were a number of
8,to come up with the
8,want you to talk about
8,at the london school of
8,that you dont have to
8,you want to get the
8,it would be nice to
8,of what we are talking
8,you want to be a
8,which i think is very
8,you have to pay for
8,out not to be true
8,we are trying to do
8,had something to do with
8,all sorts of things that
8,is that the united states
8,which is a lot of
8,in the book and i
8,there are people in the
8,at the end of that
8,you have any thoughts on
8,do with the fact that
8,take a look at the
8,think is going to happen
8,theres a little bit of
8,there have been a lot
8,think of this as a
8,as you point out the
8,in the united states a
8,way of looking at the
8,i have to say that
8,were not going to be
8,it would be a good
8,i mean by that is
8,at the same time it
8,try to figure out what
8,if you just look at
8,and all the rest of
8,it will be interesting to
8,if you want to make
8,in the savings and loan
8,as a result of this
8,dont have to go to
8,i dont want to say
8,at the end of this
8,and the people who are
8,when it comes to the
8,and i think the answer
8,so when we talk about
8,that there has been a
8,so in the case of
8,theres not a lot of
8,and those of us who
8,to the point where they
8,that they are not going
8,it turned out to be
8,that turns out to be
8,in the book is the
8,if you want to do
8,i agree with that guest
8,i want to focus on
8,not going to be the
8,the fact that there was
8,i dont know if i
8,what to do about it
8,that a lot of what
8,what you mean by that
8,i agree with that but
8,and so as a result
8,we dont know how much
8,the way i think about
8,were going to come back
8,i want to make a
8,the federal reserve bank of
8,are going to try to
8,long term capital management ltcm
8,russ so one of the
8,they were not going to
8,would not be able to
8,on the other hand you
8,a couple of things that
8,it would be great to
8,in the united kingdom and
8,the rate of growth of
8,and so as a consequence
8,that you have to have
8,the troubled asset relief program
8,what they do is they
8,a lot of people were
8,nothing to do with it
8,little they really know about
8,and i think that was
8,it easier for people to
8,a lot to be said
8,at the same time we
8,not going to do it
8,i think is a very
8,most of the time we
8,you have to be able
8,but the people who are
8,in one way or another
8,were a lot of people
8,i think that is a
8,a lot of the people
8,you have to go to
8,skin in the game and
8,that they were going to
8,by the time you get
8,to be able to say
8,you look at the data
8,when you look at it
8,when i was a kid
8,how little they really know
8,dont know what to do
8,will be interesting to see
8,that when you look at
8,one side or the other
8,it has nothing to do
8,in the case of a
8,lot of what we do
8,at the end of his
8,but part of it is
8,if you go to a
8,and the reason is that
8,a very good job of
8,the way a lot of
8,we have to have a
8,thats the way the world
8,i dont want to suggest
8,the other hand if you
8,figure out how to make
8,pay a lot of attention
8,in the new york times
8,to go out of business
8,i think there will be
8,it would be a very
8,going on at the same
8,in the theory of moral
8,the end of the story
8,no one is going to
8,a huge amount of money
8,we need to think about
8,we have to do something
8,in the united states or
8,how much of it is
8,to make the world a
8,in the road to serfdom
8,theres some truth to that
8,have to do with the
8,want to get back to
8,want to say anything about
8,is that most of the
8,that there are people who
8,theres a lot to be
7,imagine a world in which
7,deposit insurance corporation improvement act
7,they are the ones that
7,hard to make the case
7,fact of the matter is
7,you are going to go
7,im not going to get
7,guest well i think it
7,i want to make sure
7,its going to be the
7,you have to be careful
7,in the book about the
7,may or may not be
7,played an important role in
7,i dont think thats a
7,let me go back to
7,and that would be a
7,russ so let me ask
7,we have to make sure
7,for a number of years
7,but i take your point
7,we would have had a
7,a couple of weeks ago
7,who is going to get
7,that in terms of the
7,russ now one of the
7,go so far as to
7,is that there is no
7,that it would be a
7,to get a lot of
7,over the last 15 years
7,how easy it is to
7,the other end of the
7,would seem to be a
7,a lot of work on
7,so lets talk about the
7,the new england journal of
7,makes a lot of sense
7,but you still have to
7,but in terms of the
7,talk about that in a
7,who are going to be
7,and its very hard to
7,theres a lot of things
7,at the library of economics
7,to the point where it
7,on the other side who
7,i dont think we are
7,as you point out they
7,if you are willing to
7,so i think its a
7,you look at the history
7,to do it is to
7,think theres some truth to
7,but a lot of it
7,that this is going to
7,i think some of the
7,but the fact is that
7,so i think theres a
7,lets go back to your
7,in a lot of cases
7,have a lot of political
7,in the united states for
7,russ do you want to
7,there has to be a
7,point of view of the
7,i think thats right i
7,think if you look at
7,if you are talking about
7,to make sure that you
7,its not going to work
7,what would have happened if
7,do you think we should
7,do you have any thoughts
7,the consumer price index cpi
7,and so on and i
7,and that seems to be
7,of course one of the
7,topic for today is your
7,get a little bit of
7,federal reserve bank of new
7,how much of that is
7,its hard to understand why
7,for those of you who
7,another way to say it
7,the bank of england and
7,lot of things going on
7,out what to do with
7,need to be able to
7,i dont want to have
7,the united states we have
7,to come to grips with
7,so i think thats a
7,it but i think its
7,whats going on is that
7,the same time i think
7,the only way you can
7,russ yeah i agree with
7,at the same time they
7,the problem is that we
7,a lot of ways to
7,you do in the book
7,i think that is the
7,london school of economics lse
7,over and over again and
7,that theres a lot of
7,has been going on for
7,of what was going on
7,a lot of other things
7,people who are in charge
7,that would be a good
7,at the same time he
7,to talk about some of
7,think thats right i think
7,dont think there is a
7,but you dont have to
7,at some point in the
7,i think in some ways
7,over the last few years
7,by the fact that the
7,the president of the united
7,are more likely to get
7,the council of economic advisers
7,was one of the most
7,how do you get that
7,going to make a lot
7,there is a tendency to
7,you are going to lose
7,the time you get to
7,nature and causes of the
7,and i dont think you
7,i want to go to
7,on at the same time
7,but i dont want to
7,talk about some of those
7,is you are going to
7,so i want you to
7,me put it this way
7,get the most out of
7,the united states on the
7,you are talking about you
7,dont have a very good
7,is going to look like
7,now one of the things
7,im not going to do
7,i think it was in
7,what do you see as
7,in terms of trying to
7,as you point out you
7,that i think is the
7,im going to try to
7,with a great deal of
7,there is a debate about
7,russ but as you point
7,toward the end of the
7,its interesting to me that
7,for a while and then
7,on and so forth and
7,i agree with you and
7,you mention in the book
7,by the number of people
7,that is a little bit
7,for the united states and
7,way to think about that
7,there are two ways to
7,when you go to a
7,one of the virtues of
7,i think its very important
7,for a long time i
7,its a little more complicated
7,at the same time there
7,i want you to talk
7,men how little they really
7,just a matter of time
7,are just not going to
7,at the heart of the
7,way i think about it
7,as you do in the
7,but it seems to be
7,it in a different way
7,going to go out of
7,does that have to do
7,i dont want to go
7,what do you think we
7,going to be hard to
7,in a lot of the
7,going to be a very
7,part of the book is
7,and they are not going
7,that in the long run
7,the way to think about
7,a lot of what you
7,dont want to suggest that
7,the nature and causes of
7,a great deal of money
7,i want to move on
7,that need to be done
7,when we are talking about
7,is the kind of thing
7,of sustainable specialization and trade
7,agree with you i think
7,in the sense that it
7,i think part of it
7,figure out what to do
7,to do in order to
7,dont have to think about
7,do you agree with that
7,talk about the role of
7,a lot of money in
7,that a lot of these
7,do you think we have
7,a situation in which the
7,think thats one of the
7,know whats going to happen
7,i dont know if we
7,to do that is to
7,in the standard of living
7,the other thought i had
7,or something like that but
7,all we have to do
7,with the fact that they
7,but part of the reason
7,of the things that ive
7,government is going to do
7,you just look at the
7,first of all i think
7,guest i think you are
7,a lot of time in
7,want to start with a
7,in a way that i
7,so you dont have to
7,way to do it is
7,insurance corporation improvement act fdicia
7,whats the evidence for that
7,to take that into account
7,get to a point where
7,thats a huge part of
7,we have to recognize that
7,at least in the united
7,are not going to do
7,i have a lot of
7,that for a long time
7,me ask you a question
7,the idea that there are
7,have in the united states
7,but i dont think that
7,year in and year out
7,to think about this is
7,what they are trying to
7,early part of the 20th
7,on and on and on
7,your reaction to that guest
7,for today is your book
7,but a lot of what
7,i think thats one of
7,things that are going to
7,and in the united states
7,how do we get there
7,it would be nice if
7,a lot of people to
7,as long as they are
7,i think theres some truth
7,and as a result the
7,not going to do that
7,because of the way the
7,we have to worry about
7,we are not in a
7,russ i dont know if
7,the vast majority of the
7,were not going to do
7,to get a handle on
7,part of the reason why
7,a lot of young people
7,when you think about the
7,going to happen in the
7,how do we get to
7,if we got rid of
7,is a lot of money
7,i think the challenge is
7,i think there was a
7,and i think part of
7,another way to think about
7,going to run out of
7,we are going to see
7,now in the united states
7,all of a sudden the
7,part of the story is
7,if you are on the
7,to communicate with each other
7,and to be able to
7,if you really want to
7,i would like to see
7,i do think there is
7,you point out there are
7,you and i have talked
7,the current state of the
7,as a way to get
7,theres not going to be
7,i think if you look
7,but i want to make
7,this is a little bit
7,im not going to be
7,a long way to go
7,theres no doubt about that
7,are going to make the
7,guest i think thats a
7,the point i want to
7,all of a sudden people
7,your thoughts on that guest
7,as long as you are
7,or whatever you want to
7,and by the way i
7,the same thing is true
7,a very small number of
7,you think we ought to
7,with the rest of the
7,due to the fact that
7,that at the end of
7,to be able to pay
7,i dont think thats the
7,if you are interested in
7,and then you have the
7,about the state of the
7,you talk about some of
7,deal with the fact that
7,in the short run and
7,you are going to say
7,a large part of the
7,are trying to do is
7,the national football league nfl
7,if they are going to
7,you are saying is that
7,its one of the things
7,but i think if you
7,dont want to do that
7,you are saying that the
7,the source of the problem
7,what goes on in the
7,federal deposit insurance corporation improvement
7,lot of what we are
7,think about it i think
7,theres a lot of evidence
7,how long it takes to
7,causes of the wealth of
7,and part of it is
7,are a lot of other
7,and this is one of
7,you want to know what
7,just in terms of the
7,there are things that are
7,that in the united states
7,on top of that you
7,and as a result of
7,and causes of the wealth
7,he won the nobel prize
7,you dont have to be
7,dont know if this is
7,a lot of other people
7,i have to say i
7,go back to the old
7,and i think thats part
7,whats your response to that
7,thats not going to be
7,the wealth of nations is
7,a lot of things going
7,had a little bit of
7,is to look at the
7,all of a sudden they
7,so if you think of
7,the will of the people
7,organization for economic cooperation and
7,to the united states and
7,we wont be able to
7,the size of the market
7,but i think there is
7,lot of people in the
7,you have to be a
7,if you want to think
7,that if you are a
7,why do you think the
7,on the other hand the
7,and it would be a
7,the way in which we
7,way to think about the
7,a small part of the
7,well i dont know if
7,to be a good thing
7,no such thing as the
7,what do you mean we
7,thoughts on that guest well
7,i dont know what they
7,its not just that they
7,at the other end of
7,the same is true of
6,people who are in the
6,the extent to which the
6,we have in the united
6,back to your earlier point
6,theres a great deal of
6,of the book which is
6,and that i think is
6,a lot of that is
6,i want to come to
6,and you look at the
6,i would say that the
6,the right kind of nothing
6,as a lender of last
6,and its not just that
6,doesnt have to be a
6,it if you look at
6,happening in the united states
6,and i think if you
6,you can do whatever you
6,theres got to be some
6,is that you have to
6,i agree with that i
6,increase in the divorce rate
6,is if you look at
6,i think thats a lot
6,a lot of times when
6,with a little bit of
6,so i think that is
6,is going on in the
6,one of the people who
6,the united states over the
6,i want to make is
6,i dont know much about
6,if you look at how
6,but i think that the
6,part of the reason for
6,to get the most out
6,by the way there are
6,russ our topic today is
6,are going to go out
6,that i think is really
6,had been allowed to go
6,but there are lots of
6,was a bit of a
6,i was struck by how
6,the question is how much
6,interesting things to say about
6,we are going to go
6,when we look at the
6,yeah i agree with you
6,id like to see it
6,to that in a second
6,be a little bit of
6,how the economy is doing
6,done a lot of work
6,i think its hard to
6,they dont have to be
6,i think we have a
6,the problem is that the
6,russ and as you point
6,it was a good idea
6,just want to mention that
6,there is still a lot
6,one of the fascinating things
6,it would have to be
6,thought you were going to
6,decline in the velocity of
6,the early days of the
6,having said that i think
6,didnt have a lot of
6,guest thats right russ and
6,thing you can do is
6,russ you are talking about
6,going to do with it
6,i think there is some
6,is that if you look
6,an increase in the money
6,to do the kind of
6,for the people who are
6,it doesnt seem to be
6,the united states is a
6,you want to make sure
6,to be able to take
6,of the themes of the
6,i think its very hard
6,im not in favor of
6,but if you go back
6,going to have to pay
6,dont need as many people
6,let me give you the
6,what do you think are
6,i want to get back
6,in the face of the
6,you end up with is
6,and i dont have a
6,i think some of them
6,want to ask you one
6,not have a lot of
6,and i have talked about
6,i think that this is
6,a group of people who
6,we are going to start
6,over the last 5 years
6,is when you look at
6,about this in the book
6,the united states which is
6,this is the way it
6,a lot of what i
6,you actually look at the
6,what was going on and
6,it takes a long time
6,for those of you listening
6,they are going to make
6,a little bit out of
6,part of the problem but
6,think thats a good thing
6,in the book but i
6,the more likely it is
6,there is some kind of
6,to figure out how it
6,is a big part of
6,by an invisible hand to
6,contraction of the money supply
6,of people who want to
6,the other hand there are
6,might be a little bit
6,i think what you are
6,the rest of the country
6,i dont know if it
6,i want to give you
6,there in the first place
6,all of these things are
6,to be in prison or
6,that there are so many
6,whats going on with the
6,the united states and you
6,which is that when you
6,to be able to make
6,the creditors of bear stearns
6,a lot of sense to
6,we talk a lot about
6,way to look at it
6,they are worried about the
6,in the velocity of money
6,there are still a lot
6,i think there is an
6,explain what you mean by
6,if you go to the
6,ill give you an example
6,and things like that but
6,dont know whats going to
6,you need to be able
6,come up with a way
6,has anything to do with
6,of the new york times
6,and we dont want to
6,i think of it as
6,more than we take in
6,washington university in st louis
6,but not as much as
6,better way to say it
6,we are going to pay
6,i think the thing that
6,can think of it as
6,of the costs and benefits
6,in the constitution of liberty
6,is a huge part of
6,agree with that i think
6,right thing to do is
6,exactly the opposite of what
6,it is certainly true that
6,a lot of problems with
6,about the fact that they
6,and they were able to
6,part of the reason we
6,in the united states were
6,they are trying to do
6,think part of it is
6,money from the rest of
6,true in the united states
6,in a lot of places
6,the best i can do
6,just the way it is
6,is not going to work
6,you think of that argument
6,is going to be in
6,you mean by that and
6,dont think we have a
6,at the moment i think
6,for a lot of reasons
6,that we are trying to
6,you are trying to figure
6,you need to do is
6,so i want to start
6,the fact that we were
6,but i dont think thats
6,in different parts of the
6,what im trying to do
6,so if you have a
6,want to make sure that
6,the last 30 years is
6,of that is due to
6,turns out to be a
6,of the council of economic
6,people who would like to
6,all over the world and
6,aware of the fact that
6,into the nature and causes
6,of the book is that
6,i think that there is
6,now we are going to
6,where a lot of people
6,theres a lot of people
6,i dont have to give
6,are doing the same thing
6,make a lot of sense
6,the same as it was
6,i like to think about
6,but i think there are
6,a run on the bank
6,theres no reason to think
6,are more likely to have
6,that weve been talking about
6,is it the case that
6,not going to have to
6,is the road to poverty
6,it would seem to me
6,one of the things people
6,out of the great depression
6,the two of them and
6,the federal home loan bank
6,what you are going to
6,and then you look at
6,some of the things they
6,about what to do about
6,going to be one of
6,i think we ought to
6,about it in the book
6,going to have to go
6,a lot of things we
6,is the way in which
6,what you are worried about
6,in the sense that you
6,you dont have to know
6,the rest of your life
6,are not part of the
6,not just in terms of
6,im not a big fan
6,and we are talking about
6,not enough to go around
6,at the same time you
6,patterns of sustainable specialization and
6,thats a very good question
6,all the rest of it
6,and then you have to
6,do x y and z
6,for the last 30 years
6,in the last couple of
6,is no such thing as
6,people who are trying to
6,so thats an example of
6,we are going to move
6,going to be people who
6,ask it a different way
6,know the answer to that
6,were almost out of time
6,right now in the united
6,while at the same time
6,there was a time when
6,if you were to go
6,has done a lot of
6,as it was in the
6,inquiry into the nature and
6,in the middle of it
6,but a lot of them
6,reserve bank of new york
6,lot to do with the
6,it in the form of
6,2013 russ were going to
6,of that is going to
6,a lot of people do
6,people who won the lottery
6,this is the kind of
6,if you want to start
6,there is a temptation to
6,how are you going to
6,that we dont know what
6,how it is that you
6,this is part of the
6,the other thing is that
6,the road to serfdom and
6,lose a lot of money
6,the goal of life is
6,some of them will be
6,as in the united states
6,its very hard to get
6,one of the reasons people
6,its going to be hard
6,because i thought it was
6,for all kinds of reasons
6,those of us who dont
6,rest of the world is
6,that we were going to
6,but that doesnt mean that
6,people are going to get
6,a little bit of an
6,thing to do is to
6,to get out of it
6,probably not going to be
6,do the best we can
6,guest well i think thats
6,im a little bit skeptical
6,it turned out that the
6,that we ought to be
6,want to get to a
6,theory of the business cycle
6,to a lot of these
6,now a lot of people
6,but i want to start
6,dont have to have a
6,that the people who are
6,a huge part of the
6,people on both sides of
6,there will be a lot
6,were going to be able
6,least in the united states
6,guest yeah and i think
6,how do you deal with
6,topic for today is a
6,its a little bit like
6,one of the great things
6,is going to lead to
6,russ i think you are
6,not going to do this
6,happen in the united states
6,a lot of money from
6,we know how to do
6,going to talk about the
6,the end of the 1970s
6,a small number of people
6,in the 1920s and 1930s
6,the other part of the
6,do it in a way
6,the chief executive officer ceo
6,we dont have a very
6,the people who are going
6,because you are going to
6,much more likely to be
6,talk about that for a
6,theres going to be this
6,whats going to happen in
6,of what you are talking
6,dont want to get into
6,the answer to that question
6,there is an incentive to
6,but lets go back to
6,up with a lot of
6,we dont know what the
6,and thats part of the
6,and there is a lot
6,it goes back to the
6,of the book is the
6,in the book there are
6,one of the most powerful
6,a very very long time
6,have to come up with
6,yeah i think thats right
6,you are going to take
6,last 30 or 40 years
6,selfsufficiency is the road to
6,a feature not a bug
6,i dont think there are
6,thats what i mean by
6,able to take advantage of
6,to know whats going on
6,that they are trying to
6,now all of a sudden
6,the same thing in the
6,they are really good at
6,the kinds of things that
6,lets move on to the
6,for the rest of your
6,not quite the same as
6,people over the age of
6,in the united states weve
6,circumstances of time and place
6,are not very good at
6,we are just going to
6,many of the things that
6,of the 20th century in
6,but i think thats the
6,more likely to be in
6,its one of the most
6,to do that i think
6,are going to make it
6,got us out of the
6,to make sure they are
6,i totally agree with you
6,russ i agree with you
6,the idea that you can
6,but you are going to
6,its not just that its
6,and i think we are
6,make as much money as
6,there are two kinds of
6,to reduce the amount of
6,are we going to get
6,guest i think there are
6,have to be very careful
6,way to do it but
6,look at the history of
6,that in a little bit
6,is going to have to
6,on the side of the
6,whats going to happen to
6,be in prison or jail
6,as you point out a
6,dont have to do that
6,i dont think it is
6,and i think it was
6,and i dont think it
6,so what happens is you
6,look at whats going on
6,it used to be that
6,most of the time the
6,i think the question is
6,whether they are going to
6,in a way that was
6,but its hard to understand
6,well i think there are
6,because you dont want to
6,for people who want to
6,a lot of examples of
6,could make a lot of
6,going to go back to
6,is that in order to
6,and so i think thats
6,think its very important to
6,do a very good job
6,the united states and other
6,i dont think theres anything
6,what i want to do
6,a lot of time to
6,thats going to be the
6,the effect of the stimulus
6,that is one of the
6,is a great deal of
6,securities and exchange commission sec
6,where you are going to
6,look at the united states
6,how do we know that
6,likely to be in prison
6,because you dont have to
6,do you think they are
6,want to be part of
6,but if you think about
6,have to think about the
6,end of the 19th century
6,i think that if you
6,do we know about that
6,it seems to me there
6,used to be able to
6,need a little bit of
6,when you look at those
6,back up a little bit
6,so one of the reasons
6,on the other side the
6,has a lot to do
6,a whole bunch of different
6,we going to do about
6,is what i call the
6,you could argue that the
6,so i dont think that
6,i think this is the
6,are the ones who are
6,by the way i dont
6,the united states if you
6,people who are worried about
6,one way to look at
6,with low levels of education
6,making the world a better
6,russ a lot of people
6,and i would argue that
6,group of people who are
6,at the state and local
6,its going to look like
6,as you point out we
6,what might we do to
6,for the rest of the
6,i thought it was a
6,the fact that you are
6,i dont know i dont
6,so on the one hand
6,the law of large numbers
6,the same amount of money
6,do you think about that
6,as much as you want
6,where does that leave us
6,in the last 50 years
6,that would seem to be
6,i do think there are
6,then on top of that
6,and you are talking about
6,we dont have a lot
6,you are talking about is
6,because a lot of people
6,is that the people who
6,not going to get into
6,its the right thing to
6,the history of economic thought
6,on the one hand you
6,a certain amount of gold
6,in a world where people
6,we have a pretty good
6,dont need to worry about
6,when you look at a
6,what you try to do
6,a certain amount of money
6,manipulation of money and credit
6,people at the top of
6,whats wrong with that argument
6,that in a second but
6,i want to start by
6,it does raise the question
6,it reminds me of the
6,so when i think about
6,the end of the month
6,hundreds of millions of people
6,be in the business of
6,they are willing to pay
6,the question is whether the
6,you think of that guest
6,and when you talk about
6,lot to be said for
6,turned out to be wrong
6,what do you do with
6,of the united states is
6,so a lot of people
6,of skin in the game
6,you spend a lot of
6,the back of the store
6,as i say in the
6,im not going to give
6,turns out not to be
6,beginning of the 20th century
6,we go back to the
6,you going to do with
6,for the sake of others
6,have to make sure that
6,that its going to be
6,dont know the answer to
6,in the way that we
6,i dont think so i
6,so im not going to
6,there are lots of ways
6,i think we are going
6,are two things that are
6,rate of growth of the
6,what we have to do
6,back to your point about
6,by the rules of the
6,in the last two years
6,they have an incentive to
6,lost a lot of money
6,in a position to be
6,it and i think thats
6,the fact that they were
6,i dont know the answer
6,turn out to be true
6,to get a sense of
6,the greater good rationalization problem
6,what the fed is doing
6,and of course they are
6,between the two of them
6,guest well i think there
6,that would be a big
6,will be a lot of
6,i think its a mistake
6,russ yeah i dont know
6,wouldnt have been able to
6,for better or for worse
6,a lot of those people
6,they know what they are
6,the kind of thing you
6,turns out to be the
6,thats one of the reasons
6,the balance sheets of banks
6,dont have to pay for
6,was a great deal of
6,for the first time in
6,im not going to say
5,to me one of the
5,in competition with each other
5,it would be better to
5,the form of lower wages
5,a lot going on there
5,world a better place and
5,have to go through the
5,way we are going to
5,a bunch of people and
5,us out of the depression
5,but its not going to
5,guest thats a good question
5,american society of civil engineers
5,a lot more in the
5,russ lets talk about that
5,a good friend of mine
5,because there are so many
5,so you are saying that
5,well talk about that in
5,something that a lot of
5,i have no doubt that
5,not everybody is going to
5,dont think we are going
5,the vast majority of our
5,in the journal of economic
5,hes got a lot of
5,we might think of as
5,talk about that a little
5,the state and local level
5,to do anything about it
5,we are going to lose
5,if you come up with
5,what is true is that
5,but i want to mention
5,dont see a lot of
5,the book one of the
5,i would add to that
5,its going to turn out
5,figure out how to do
5,couldnt agree with you more
5,on this program a few
5,i dont think its an
5,in a lot of different
5,a lot of people got
5,are a number of things
5,the monetary history of the
5,as a percentage of gdp
5,a lot of money for
5,look at it and say
5,the last 40 or 50
5,what does that have to
5,how did you get involved
5,people are going to have
5,out in the middle of
5,one of the things is
5,a very good job and
5,people all over the world
5,a hell of a lot
5,so lets go back to
5,role of government in the
5,over the last 40 years
5,think thats a huge part
5,once in a while but
5,in the way in which
5,not the right way to
5,going to be on the
5,going on on the ground
5,and there are lots of
5,me a little bit of
5,know what the answer is
5,dont know what they are
5,think there is a lot
5,what we ought to be
5,do you want to talk
5,to say anything else about
5,as you say its a
5,it because i think its
5,if by an invisible hand
5,what you are saying guest
5,about whats going on in
5,guest i agree with you
5,dont think so i think
5,i wanted to talk about
5,going to be very hard
5,why is it that the
5,do you have in mind
5,for a bunch of reasons
5,what have we learned about
5,what they want to do
5,weve been talking about and
5,is the only thing that
5,you know its going to
5,going to be very good
5,rid of a lot of
5,the onset of the great
5,government has to step in
5,what the rules of the
5,have a lot to do
5,on the one hand the
5,the glass is half full
5,a lot of this is
5,two things first of all
5,so the first thing is
5,just to take an example
5,about that for a minute
5,what works and what doesnt
5,a little bit of time
5,that there is no such
5,agree with you that the
5,they will be bailed out
5,why do you think we
5,we are not able to
5,lot of the people who
5,those with low levels of
5,if you want to say
5,talked a little bit about
5,lot of money into the
5,and i think thats one
5,say theres a lot of
5,if you think of it
5,a lot of people i
5,do you have any idea
5,let me just give you
5,a couple of things i
5,that people want to buy
5,guest i think that the
5,its easy for me to
5,in the second half of
5,part of the problem guest
5,ask you a question about
5,the last decade or so
5,do you think thats true
5,for the rest of us
5,id like you to talk
5,are on the other side
5,the problem is if you
5,before i do that i
5,both sides of the market
5,are worried about the future
5,not what we are talking
5,weve got a lot of
5,an important part of the
5,about what they are doing
5,and i just want to
5,are many ways in which
5,the best you can do
5,a big chunk of the
5,have a certain amount of
5,you have some interesting things
5,the fact that there is
5,its not a question of
5,im going to put you
5,and as a result when
5,and one of the key
5,talked about this before on
5,any stretch of the imagination
5,and i want to say
5,that this is not a
5,if you are thinking about
5,able to come up with
5,want to go to a
5,two issues here one is
5,of the business cycle and
5,whats interesting about that is
5,i think we should be
5,what was going to happen
5,to the u of chicago
5,part of it is because
5,were in the middle of
5,you want to say something
5,other point i want to
5,you had a lot of
5,there is no such thing
5,but the bottom line is
5,a couple of different ways
5,why are they doing that
5,going to get a lot
5,in the beginning of the
5,as you point out if
5,of human action but not
5,guest well one of the
5,i think we could do
5,you are probably going to
5,we know and dont know
5,the more you have to
5,is that many of the
5,many times on this program
5,that in the absence of
5,dont have to be a
5,is the right way to
5,are going to be an
5,in prison or jail than
5,i see a lot of
5,that you can have a
5,if you were to take
5,in the sense of the
5,is that correct guest yeah
5,a lot of these things
5,the question is if you
5,kind of reaction have you
5,you know if you are
5,make the case that the
5,to figure out what to
5,on the front page of
5,russ theres a lot of
5,than the value of the
5,is going to have a
5,is that correct guest yes
5,me ask you a different
5,something on the order of
5,we dont have a good
5,to state and local governments
5,and thats why i think
5,the late 1970s early 1980s
5,of not being able to
5,so one of the problems
5,i think the problem with
5,have to worry about getting
5,let me give you another
5,was one of the first
5,tens of thousands of people
5,but i dont know what
5,it doesnt work that way
5,its hard to understand how
5,to the people who are
5,we want to make sure
5,are going to see a
5,be to get rid of
5,over the last couple of
5,one of the problems is
5,do the best they can
5,a lot of interesting things
5,its hard to imagine that
5,what does that mean guest
5,you are talking about in
5,we were going to be
5,and when you think about
5,have to think about what
5,russ thats a good point
5,what do we do now
5,how long would it take
5,fool yourself and you are
5,a lot of different ways
5,dont know what you are
5,of the things i find
5,in the united states what
5,we can talk about that
5,make a lot more money
5,because as you point out
5,the turn of the century
5,im going to disagree with
5,are still a lot of
5,and were going to talk
5,and then you also have
5,think we ought to be
5,do in the united states
5,those who won the lottery
5,happened in the united states
5,there is a role for
5,who won the nobel prize
5,so its very hard to
5,the other is that the
5,can do whatever you want
5,think this is going to
5,an awful lot of people
5,look at the impact of
5,over the last few decades
5,you give in the book
5,what do you mean guest
5,too big to fail and
5,if you want to talk
5,that needs to be done
5,i think theres something to
5,the role of government in
5,a lot of money so
5,of one kind or another
5,you have to make sure
5,middle of the 20th century
5,at the time was that
5,we have to think about
5,in the size of the
5,more than it is worth
5,in the last 15 years
5,is the fact that we
5,and thats why we have
5,in a world where the
5,it does seem to be
5,to make it harder for
5,why i am not a
5,a lot of stuff in
5,this is a case where
5,are going to be doing
5,get to the bottom of
5,the current population survey cps
5,i dont know what that
5,the united states as well
5,to get rid of it
5,to look at the data
5,i think that theres a
5,a lot more people are
5,to pay more attention to
5,russ i want to close
5,the way its going to
5,worst thing you can do
5,comes from the fact that
5,to understand whats going on
5,that if you were to
5,what they are doing and
5,because they dont have the
5,not going to get the
5,going on right now in
5,so this is not a
5,i dont know i think
5,but there is a lot
5,i dont know if that
5,im going to make a
5,are really talking about a
5,to do a lot more
5,it seems like a good
5,think its a good idea
5,than it would have been
5,for a long time there
5,it seems to me and
5,the pure theory of capital
5,and i dont know if
5,a huge part of it
5,i thought you were going
5,of the great depression and
5,at the end of a
5,and so on so i
5,the book you talk about
5,what you are suggesting is
5,russ what do you mean
5,all of a sudden its
5,in the united states at
5,a lot of political power
5,in the 19th century and
5,there is not a single
5,is good for the economy
5,the envy of the world
5,thats the way it works
5,have a lot of trouble
5,to get the economy going
5,is part of the reason
5,on the basis of the
5,you dont want to do
5,think is going to be
5,the fight of the century
5,the fact that people are
5,for a year or two
5,there are very few people
5,we are going to run
5,as a matter of fact
5,not just because of the
5,do we have any evidence
5,dont think we need to
5,from the top down and
5,is going to do the
5,theres a huge amount of
5,we want to live in
5,in the form of lower
5,in the book that i
5,economic cooperation and development oecd
5,back to this question of
5,the right way to say
5,there is no reason to
5,for a long time in
5,about the nature of the
5,know a little bit about
5,borrowed a lot of money
5,to a point where you
5,and thats the kind of
5,let me come back to
5,is that we have a
5,in the public school system
5,of the things that happened
5,go out of business and
5,but it could be true
5,we were one of the
5,that part of the reason
5,the proper role of government
5,an hour and a half
5,russ well i think thats
5,it was a period of
5,but not a lot of
5,what evidence do we have
5,do think there is a
5,its not a coincidence that
5,argument to be made that
5,but i think its important
5,but the other thing that
5,i think you are going
5,it would be great if
5,more likely you are to
5,if you want to see
5,that would have been a
5,russ lets talk about your
5,and im sure there are
5,an increase in the demand
5,we are looking at a
5,they are going to run
5,that if you go back
5,if we dont do anything
5,they are looking at the
5,are not going to pay
5,the chair of the fed
5,for more than it is
5,going to be the same
5,when i look to the
5,when you are in the
5,we know how to make
5,and then well talk about
5,in the united states because
5,in a lot of these
5,to where it was before
5,are going to be people
5,you make in the book
5,was one of the big
5,you might be able to
5,the last 30 or 40
5,want to move on to
5,it reminds me a little
5,even if you are not
5,to reduce the probability of
5,have to go back to
5,get a lot of money
5,i think most people think
5,that seems to be the
5,i think that was a
5,the world we live in
5,with a high school degree
5,one of the lessons of
5,the other side of it
5,they dont want to do
5,what we might think of
5,russ well i think the
5,the expense of the rest
5,we have a lot more
5,both the left and the
5,more than a billion dollars
5,thing we have to do
5,who wins and who loses
5,have much of an impact
5,there was an increase in
5,you are in the middle
5,is that good or bad
5,the national institute of health
5,the people at the top
5,a lot of things and
5,20 or 30 years ago
5,would be to get rid
5,side of the balance sheet
5,in the washington dc area
5,what we are seeing is
5,there is such a thing
5,in the same way as
5,when you look at these
5,in the old days you
5,but theres a lot of
5,i want to get to
5,hundreds of thousands of people
5,didnt have to worry about
5,a lot of people find
5,little more complicated than that
5,it is going to be
5,the author of the study
5,how difficult it is to
5,when you get to the
5,you are going to put
5,most of the people who
5,take a couple of examples
5,in the name of the
5,comes to the united states
5,may not be the best
5,and one of the problems
5,was supposed to be a
5,increase in the price of
5,russ well i agree with
5,do you think are the
5,for a very very long
5,so in terms of the
5,want to go to the
5,i think thats what we
5,that means you have to
5,that it would have been
5,back 100 cents on the
5,do the best you can
5,have been able to borrow
5,example in the book of
5,at the high school level
5,can come up with a
5,so what do you think
5,think a lot of us
5,and they dont want to
5,is going to be different
5,guest yeah thats right and
5,in the house of representatives
5,a few years ago and
5,because i think most people
5,but i want to talk
5,to the fact that there
5,where we are right now
5,people like you and me
5,that is part of the
5,united states in the last
5,to say we are not
5,you wont be able to
5,in the united states by
5,those of you who are
5,and we dont have a
5,but i think we are
5,guest i think it was
5,is one of the few
5,at the same time but
5,at the u of rochester
5,about in terms of the
5,know you are going to
5,at the end of wwii
5,would be a lot of
5,one of my favorite examples
5,and as a result they
5,the national bureau of economic
5,these are people who are
5,do you think that the
5,take the job that pays
5,other way to think about
5,in the sense that if
5,that when you think about
5,some of the people who
5,not going to be in
5,that they dont have any
5,in a way that makes
5,i think there is no
5,want to get into the
5,a lot of them were
5,if you actually look at
5,that was my next question
5,russ i have to say
5,i had a lot of
5,we were talking about earlier
5,out how it is that
5,could be part of the
5,dont know what the answer
5,rules of the game are
5,at the back of the
5,to go all the way
5,in the back of our
5,i argue in the book
5,i think in terms of
5,in terms of the way
5,of the fascinating things about
5,but i think you are
5,sell something for more than
5,were going to move on
5,dropped out of high school
5,in the short run to
5,we know a lot about
5,a little bit more about
5,i think there is something
5,a small group of people
5,of what goes on in
5,what i think is a
5,going to go to the
5,the authors of the study
5,at the same time if
5,but thats not the way
5,whats going on at the
5,dont think of it as
5,so if you think about
5,they dont have any interest
5,come to the united states
5,a way to think about
5,national institute of health nih
5,try to tease out the
5,that this was going to
5,i want to live in
5,lot of people who dont
5,is what do you think
5,not in a position to
5,your eggs in one basket
5,that we are in a
5,we are going to let
5,a quarter of a percent
5,we dont have time to
5,in a number of ways
5,for people who dont have
5,but i think we should
5,they are going to come
5,it guest yeah i think
5,and then some of the
5,the fact that theres a
5,the federal communications commission fcc
5,you wouldnt be able to
5,by the fact that they
5,that i dont have to
5,there are people out there
5,make in the book is
5,this is one of those
5,on the right side of
5,are going to do it
5,it makes a big difference
5,do you think thats going
5,other parts of the economy
5,going to be much more
5,was one of the few
5,say the same thing about
5,the right way to do
5,lot of time thinking about
5,think part of the problem
5,the people who have been
5,the end of the 1930s
5,that person is going to
5,i think its true that
5,im not sure thats true
5,than they otherwise would be
5,hayek the curious task of
5,said theres a lot of
5,its not a matter of
5,a lot more than that
5,to think of themselves as
5,about the current state of
5,how they are going to
5,what kind of reaction have
5,the food and drug administration
5,in the next 5 years
5,what it means to be
5,theory of moral sentiments by
5,are all sorts of things
5,and well come back to
5,guest well i think its
5,talking about in terms of
5,by the way its not
5,more than it takes in
5,the way you think about
5,so i agree with you
5,the value of the house
5,in terms of the business
5,long period of time and
5,think about it there are
5,last 10 or 15 years
5,dont have any interest in
5,the repeal of the corn
5,is going to get the
5,we need to have a
5,the question is what do
5,and a little bit of
5,with the fact that there
5,and as a result you
5,for the last 40 years
5,but the reality is that
5,its a good idea to
5,and i think most of
5,the kind of person who
5,group versus the control group
5,have to keep in mind
5,there are a thousand things
5,really want to do is
5,there was going to be
5,increase the size of the
5,if you dont have any
5,im going to ask you
5,they are never going to
5,thing i want to mention
5,i think it was the
5,in the united states who
5,and i think thats an
5,is that when you get
5,we are talking about and
5,we tend to think of
5,economic consequences of the peace
5,it would be better if
5,it a lot of people
5,and we are not going
5,you are really saying is
5,think of it as the
5,of course a lot of
5,of the size of the
5,figure out how it is
5,and the rest of it
5,and as a result we
5,going to be a problem
5,that the only way to
5,of the road to serfdom
5,is probably not going to
5,argue in the book that
5,a lot of people and
5,and the second thing is
5,last 40 or 50 years
5,is good for the country
5,one of the problems of
5,part of the reason its
5,about it in terms of
5,push back a little bit
5,going to be bailed out
5,look at the data and
5,seems to be a little
5,as a result of a
5,a decline in the velocity
5,that runs through the book
5,and this is what i
5,that you are trying to
5,you get a different answer
5,to go to law school
5,you are worried about the
5,come back and talk about
5,the united states a lot
5,an argument to be made
5,and then we are going
5,you go back and look
5,and i think you are
5,fact that a lot of
5,the monetary and financial system
5,relative to the united states
5,i totally agree with that
5,the role of the fed
5,in the united states people
5,and the same is true
5,right way to say it
5,have anything to say about
5,just to make sure that
5,do we really want to
5,a lot of the stuff
5,because i think a lot
5,what you just said is
5,and by the way the
5,i was in graduate school
5,think there are some people
5,of the power of the
5,of the affordable care act
5,was that it was a
5,correct me if im wrong
5,i dont think we know
5,how do you think the
5,chief executive officer ceo of
5,you want to make a
5,what we want to do
5,a tragedy of the commons
5,lets take the con out
5,way to think of it
5,what we were talking about
5,russ well i dont know
5,the rest of us are
5,lot of people who are
5,even in the united states
5,but the most important thing
5,you go back and you
5,a lot of romance about
5,the idea here is that
5,and then on top of
5,at the expense of others
5,know what you are doing
5,thought it was a good
5,to make as much money
5,to think like an economist
5,make much of a difference
5,the united states we dont
5,i think it would have
5,part of the problem i
5,have some interesting things to
5,think its very hard to
5,i want to say that
5,many of the people who
5,it has to be done
5,it makes a lot of
5,try to figure out how
5,is to make sure that
5,in the last half of
5,i think is part of
5,growth of the money supply
5,well i think its a
5,in the first place so
5,are some of the other
5,and what that means is
5,because of the nature of
5,wed like it to be
5,but it is true that
5,what do you have to
5,at the same time so
5,that a lot of us
5,to spend more money on
5,on the nature of the
5,think that one of the
5,to be able to go
5,at least for a while
5,in the united states have
5,that government is going to
5,how do you do that
5,going to make a difference
5,by any stretch of the
5,what you had to do
5,you had to get a
5,that we have in the
5,why do you say that
5,they are going to take
5,and we dont know how
5,the american society of civil
5,at the very end of
5,what they are doing but
5,job that pays the most
5,x y and z and
5,in the united states where
5,guest i dont know i
5,is as you point out
5,at the level of the
5,you think thats going to
5,of the total amount of
5,im going to do this
5,to make it easy for
5,so i have to be
5,well one of the things
5,weve made a lot of
5,think theres a lot to
5,if you take a look
5,how do you figure out
5,agree with you on that
5,but having said that i
5,is that its hard to
5,was the way to go
5,and we ought to be
5,say im not going to
5,the end of the 19th
5,there isnt going to be
5,we are going to make
5,so why is it that
5,that one of the reasons
5,turned out to be right
5,and i think the reason
5,some parts of the world
5,a lot of interest in
5,the road to serfdom which
5,some interesting things to say
5,put people back to work
5,not just that they are
5,get your reaction to it
5,what you are saying and
5,will not be able to
5,in the world around us
5,a good thing for the
5,i dont know how much
5,have to look at it
5,the con out of econometrics
5,think about it this way
5,we think of as the
5,come back to that later
5,you know one of the
5,to think about these things
5,is to be able to
5,ask you a different question
5,i just want to make
5,what i think is the
5,that we are not going
5,in the short run it
5,want to talk about it
5,what we can do is
5,going to get their money
5,going to have to come
5,the answer to that is
5,with bruce bueno de mesquita
5,the very end of the
5,im sympathetic to that view
5,talk in the book about
5,one of the cruelest things
5,more and more and more
5,to have that kind of
5,its not a lot of
5,be interesting to see how
5,there doesnt seem to be
5,that i think thats a
5,a lot of the world
5,to the size of the
5,thats not to say that
5,in the united states with
5,part of the reason it
5,this was going to be
5,is a good way to
5,onset of the great depression
5,going to have a hard
5,guest thats right russ so
5,if you were going to
5,what they were doing and
5,its a bit of a
5,and it would have been
5,to figure out whats going
5,i think its just a
5,the united states and they
5,you can look at the
5,crisis in the united states
5,not the same as the
5,do you think there is
5,to that in a little
5,the united states right now
5,to be part of the
5,we need a lot more
5,but a lot of times
5,in a way i think
5,i dont have to worry
5,im going to read a
5,the people who want to
5,the last part of the
5,then on the other hand
5,try to do is to
5,we know anything about that
5,a lot of changes in
5,at the time and it
5,want to start with some
5,paper in the journal of
5,there are many ways in
5,is in the united states
5,get out of the way
5,you want to live in
5,if you want to give
5,point which i think is
5,do you think thats a
5,look back at the last
5,on for a long time
5,in the form of a
5,we want to look at
5,know they are going to
5,the middle of nowhere and
5,are going to do something
5,one of the issues that
5,the sense that they are
5,its not just that we
5,take the con out of
5,there has to be some
5,is not a good thing
5,if you had your druthers
5,you try to do is
5,our standard of living is
5,need to look at the
5,figure out whats going on
5,i think thats an important
5,and there are a number
5,that comes out of the
5,problem i have with that
5,you were talking about the
5,lot of time in the
5,based on the idea that
5,to make a lot more
5,i think if you are
5,out that a lot of
5,the history of the world
5,and i think they are
5,they were going to make
5,if you want to understand
5,going to get a very
5,on in the united states
5,a way to make the
5,the job that pays the
5,they are trying to get
5,is a little bit different
5,no reason to think that
5,when we are trying to
5,then we are going to
5,a little bit of money
5,the rest of the time
5,and on top of that
5,when i look at the
5,spent a lot of money
5,which is part of the
5,would have picked it up
5,part of whats going on
5,one way to do that
5,its a little hard to
5,because on the one hand
5,dont know what it is
5,russ well one of the
5,a reasonable amount of time
5,matter of time before we
5,and on the other hand
5,you are just going to
5,that to the side the
5,the fed and the treasury
5,have a lot of time
5,it was the result of
5,and of course we have
5,way of thinking about the
5,its a waste of time
5,as if by an invisible
5,i think that one of
5,a lot of people thought
5,and then all of a
5,you want to get a
5,the united states there are
5,in the old days if
5,dont want to live in
5,the financial sector and the
5,there is a great deal
5,one of the reasons its
5,russ so lets turn to
5,is that i think the
5,of the things that the
5,a year or two ago
5,time in prison or jail
5,whats the best way to
5,of what we do in
5,2014 russ our topic for
5,in the first place but
5,united states over the last
5,of the reason is that
5,in the united states of
5,and the problem is that
5,are talking about you are
5,there are other people who
5,in the value of the
5,as a jumping off point
5,in terms of how much
5,do we know about the
5,reminds me a little bit
5,the middle of the 20th
5,people who are willing to
5,taking in more energy than
5,about the role of the
5,there would be a lot
5,the course of a year
5,wont be able to pay
5,anything to do with it
5,we have to deal with
5,both in terms of the
5,it takes a lot of
5,in the late 1990s and
5,a very large fraction of
5,going to have to have
5,it seems to me they
5,be able to get a
5,get rid of a lot
5,in the midst of the
5,is that we have to
5,but i think it is
5,russ well i think its
5,one of the main things
5,a lot of what government
5,it used to be and
5,are your thoughts on how
5,what can we do to
5,was going on in the
5,united states a lot of
5,the fact that they had
4,guest i think theres a
4,is that part of the
4,in that sense i think
4,there are a few things
4,of the things i like
4,but it doesnt seem to
4,do is the thing that
4,on one side or the
4,for example there is a
4,you know a lot of
4,but its not just the
4,of the mont pelerin society
4,cities in the united states
4,have to worry about it
4,i want to let you
4,to get back to your
4,those are the ones that
4,im going to start with
4,is a little more complicated
4,are people out there who
4,because i dont want to
4,is that when you have
4,the high school dropout rate
4,russ yeah i think its
4,what is the cause of
4,a little bit of it
4,but if they dont have
4,that happens all the time
4,i think its a fascinating
4,to put more money into
4,that there is very little
4,want to react to that
4,to have a hard time
4,if we could find a
4,person in the united states
4,what would you do about
4,we are going to end
4,over the last 3 years
4,dont know what that means
4,trying to get people to
4,is the idea that the
4,want to call it and
4,are going to be some
4,in the book of the
4,i think would be a
4,me give you another example
4,let you react to it
4,and as a result there
4,are going to do that
4,to live in san francisco
4,of the things that makes
4,in the last few decades
4,in the late 1960s and
4,back to that in a
4,so thats part of the
4,i think its one of
4,we have a set of
4,to think about that is
4,is that a good summary
4,think youd be hardpressed to
4,and then you get a
4,russ i think its a
4,a lot of the things
4,the united states and its
4,out in the last few
4,a million dollars worth of
4,where you are trying to
4,let me ask a different
4,are citizens of the same
4,my view is that the
4,not the kind of thing
4,you have to think of
4,want to talk first about
4,that you were going to
4,whats been happening to the
4,to be able to have
4,agree with you that its
4,seems to me one of
4,which is how do you
4,the united states it was
4,in the future and the
4,russ do we know anything
4,federal home loan bank board
4,how do we know the
4,a lot on this program
4,but the point is its
4,what they are doing with
4,a big increase in the
4,what we should do is
4,and i want to get
4,is a little bit like
4,going to give you an
4,them are going to be
4,you are referring to the
4,way to think about things
4,you are talking about this
4,that doesnt have to be
4,are going to vote for
4,a little bit about that
4,states in the united states
4,you dont have time to
4,but its more than that
4,way to do it and
4,why would i want to
4,what they did with the
4,me an email at mailecontalkorg
4,there are lots and lots
4,dont think thats going to
4,that people at the bottom
4,youve got to look at
4,do what you want to
4,how do you get to
4,that was a good idea
4,thats what im trying to
4,many times in the book
4,in a little bit but
4,here is that if you
4,what would be the implications
4,back and look at the
4,i think is a little
4,i think most of the
4,so im going to give
4,the limits of our knowledge
4,but then there was a
4,what i was going to
4,it seems to be a
4,the answer is i dont
4,could do a better job
4,bear stearns and lehman brothers
4,to come up with something
4,because i think its such
4,we should be looking at
4,i think the reason is
4,the bank of the united
4,well come back and talk
4,spent a great deal of
4,would be a mistake to
4,a lot to say about
4,is an important part of
4,there are lots of other
4,the second half of 2008
4,is supposed to be a
4,there is an immense amount
4,on the edge of a
4,you fall in love with
4,over the last 40 or
4,which was one of the
4,the flip side of that
4,you cant get out of
4,go on i want to
4,so you have a lot
4,by the end of this
4,a lot of truth to
4,we can do is we
4,do i just want to
4,i could be wrong but
4,of the late 19th century
4,there are people who dont
4,is that when you look
4,but they are not doing
4,look at that and say
4,tell us what you did
4,to the united states from
4,are two ways to get
4,do you see as the
4,over the next 5 years
4,the fraction of the population
4,again and again and again
4,the funny thing is that
4,as much as they can
4,but they are not going
4,i think this is one
4,as much as we want
4,there are many people who
4,carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
4,in our standard of living
4,about the size of the
4,look at it from a
4,the extent to which we
4,came up with this idea
4,good thing or a bad
4,not a good idea to
4,to give you an example
4,i think whats happening is
4,be able to have a
4,a lot of time talking
4,you have to ask yourself
4,why is it that when
4,and i dont know how
4,about that a little bit
4,we should be able to
4,one of which is the
4,the question is how do
4,the fact that when you
4,because we dont have the
4,and we can talk about
4,to the behavior of the
4,than they otherwise would have
4,anything else you want to
4,come from the fact that
4,but we dont want to
4,lot of what government does
4,what we know and dont
4,so for example if you
4,to do it in a
4,the way people think about
4,last thing i want to
4,and they dont have to
4,to that because i think
4,the government would bail them
4,so the rest of the
4,a little bit like the
4,go back to the point
4,because if you look at
4,are going to come out
4,to the top of the
4,so a couple of things
4,outside the united states and
4,because there is a lot
4,in the money supply and
4,you cant get rid of
4,i think most people are
4,what we see is that
4,dont make a lot of
4,part of it is that
4,they are willing to accept
4,a little bit which is
4,in part because of the
4,russ so let me just
4,i dont have to sell
4,well i think that is
4,world was coming to an
4,but if you are going
4,i think that people who
4,in the world in the
4,and so i think in
4,for the doctor to move
4,and the answer is because
4,of how it is that
4,its not just that there
4,i read your book i
4,have been one of the
4,but the problem is that
4,the way in which this
4,the fair labor standards act
4,going to be a good
4,people thought it would be
4,is going to work out
4,a lot of people want
4,it as a kind of
4,are we talking about here
4,more about your health than
4,in the middle of this
4,seems to me that we
4,in the face of that
4,there seems to be a
4,the chinese yuan is undervalued
4,that there would be a
4,to get to the point
4,2012 russ your book is
4,i want to say one
4,since then there have been
4,if you believe that the
4,so in the book i
4,of the things that has
4,state and local governments are
4,doing a very good job
4,it is very hard to
4,we are taking a risk
4,of the value of the
4,the same kind of thing
4,know if you want to
4,in the private sector and
4,on the other side but
4,as you point out and
4,is that correct guest thats
4,to the financial crisis and
4,and the question is how
4,are in the process of
4,as much as they should
4,you point out in your
4,want to be wiped out
4,we dont spend a lot
4,go back to the 1970s
4,put a lot of stock
4,and i think your point
4,talk about what you think
4,but we are not going
4,want to make a lot
4,you are always going to
4,that there is a very
4,dont think you talk about
4,im going to give them
4,to go back to your
4,you dont have to do
4,going to come to an
4,for the most part the
4,and people are going to
4,particular circumstances of time and
4,theres been a lot more
4,what i was talking about
4,i think it is true
4,a whole lot of time
4,they are doing better than
4,of that guest i think
4,lets move on to a
4,is one of the key
4,why is it that we
4,if you didnt have the
4,you can think of it
4,you want your kid to
4,is an immense amount of
4,is an increase in the
4,an interesting question i think
4,citizens of the same country
4,in the absence of that
4,there is no question that
4,bunch of people who say
4,this is not going to
4,what you have is a
4,because they dont have to
4,got to be able to
4,well get to that in
4,theres going to be an
4,that cant go on forever
4,be better off if we
4,reduce the probability of violence
4,agree with you and i
4,and things like that so
4,talk about whats going on
4,do you have to pay
4,the millennium villages project is
4,dont have skin in the
4,it takes to be a
4,if you think of a
4,in the case of fannie
4,one of the big things
4,part of the problem not
4,is based on the idea
4,gotten a lot more expensive
4,and it has to do
4,economics is the study of
4,going to have an effect
4,they are trying to make
4,if you live in a
4,this is not a good
4,dont want to be wiped
4,do you want to do
4,is there are so many
4,might we do to make
4,two ways to get to
4,on that i think the
4,a lot of this stuff
4,because you have to be
4,not a lot of money
4,and i think when you
4,i want to stick with
4,right thing to do and
4,russ i want to ask
4,think we can teach people
4,the kind of people who
4,one of the points i
4,and there are a couple
4,have much to do with
4,in the united states when
4,them we are going to
4,there is no way that
4,the question is whats the
4,and some of it is
4,think its more than that
4,thing to remember is that
4,in the united kingdom the
4,going to do something about
4,say we just need to
4,are going to take a
4,and this is not a
4,take care of themselves and
4,seem to be a good
4,from all over the world
4,you want it to be
4,have to get to the
4,back on the gold standard
4,the question is is it
4,we dont want you to
4,people with high levels of
4,of things that are not
4,turned out to be very
4,money into the banking system
4,how you are going to
4,on how to think about
4,and the fact that the
4,and the question is what
4,and i think thats what
4,rest of the economy so
4,its very hard to make
4,to do that you can
4,but i think thats a
4,born in the united states
4,but you are suggesting that
4,in the context of the
4,a number of people who
4,what would you do if
4,part of the increase in
4,what we think is the
4,the problem is is that
4,you double the money supply
4,a pretty good job of
4,youve spent a lot of
4,what we ought to do
4,i dont want to make
4,the best we can do
4,what do you want to
4,that a lot of this
4,im going to go back
4,that guest well i think
4,i dont know whats going
4,to go back to that
4,of the rest of us
4,in the case of economics
4,the united states is the
4,get to that in a
4,so lets look at the
4,fact that they are not
4,guest well its hard to
4,they might be able to
4,couple of reasons one is
4,can make a lot of
4,there will be people who
4,to live in a society
4,russ well thats true guest
4,a variety of reasons and
4,spending a lot of time
4,you want to react to
4,of the things i found
4,they dont have the right
4,part of the reason they
4,cant get there from here
4,if i want to buy
4,that there would be some
4,we might be able to
4,reasons one of which is
4,russ i couldnt agree with
4,hard to get people to
4,to think in terms of
4,a lot of these issues
4,why did they do that
4,that was part of the
4,was the head of the
4,want to close with a
4,to think about it but
4,do a little bit of
4,in the face of this
4,its more complicated than that
4,saying we are going to
4,on and so forth so
4,but i think this is
4,a little bit of that
4,it would be in the
4,but the point i want
4,are large differences in the
4,of the fact that there
4,so i think thats what
4,the idea that we can
4,you want to make the
4,on the other side its
4,i never thought about it
4,were on the edge of
4,going to get ahead of
4,is a lot of evidence
4,if you dont have the
4,that i think is very
4,money and give it to
4,the particular circumstances of time
4,it took me a long
4,you to talk about what
4,the kind of thing we
4,you have an incentive to
4,i dont know if im
4,got all their money back
4,chairman of the council of
4,if you think about that
4,well i agree with you
4,which i think is part
4,because there are a lot
4,one way or another and
4,to be done in the
4,one of the advantages of
4,as if it were a
4,and by that i mean
4,dont have the incentive to
4,how we are going to
4,is the same as it
4,could go the other way
4,if the government increases its
4,europe and the united states
4,rules in the united states
4,i am not a conservative
4,and it turns out to
4,not going to talk about
4,how do you think that
4,they are doing when they
4,we do know that the
4,how important is it to
4,tend to think about it
4,at different points in time
4,would have been much more
4,does seem to be a
4,me say it a different
4,and so on but i
4,has to be able to
4,going to be very difficult
4,case of fannie and freddie
4,want to say something about
4,the fact that its not
4,and so if you are
4,the future and i think
4,it reminds me of a
4,it looks like there is
4,that when it comes to
4,would be a lot more
4,have an idea of what
4,the kind of things that
4,be able to get the
4,want to talk about some
4,the fact that some of
4,are going to run out
4,know what would have happened
4,a chapter in the book
4,which i think has been
4,its hard to make the
4,have to go back and
4,on the way to the
4,we want to talk about
4,there are circumstances in which
4,we have to be very
4,i have a number of
4,the vast majority of people
4,thats the nature of the
4,what they know and dont
4,some of the history of
4,that was the thing that
4,sitting on a lot of
4,but i dont know if
4,get what you pay for
4,how do they do that
4,thats right and i think
4,in the end of the
4,we are going to come
4,heads i win tails you
4,what kind of reaction did
4,and of course as you
4,i think the main thing
4,think this is one of
4,at the time and i
4,to where they were before
4,are trying to do and
4,the standard of living in
4,dont know how much of
4,the rule of law is
4,russ well let me ask
4,send me an email at
4,rest of the world was
4,is we are going to
4,i dont have to do
4,of the rule of law
4,and there were a lot
4,that the united states is
4,are willing to pay for
4,you want to do it
4,what we just talked about
4,a number of times on
4,are going to reduce the
4,promises that have been made
4,so they dont have to
4,on a case by case
4,it would be a mistake
4,the book which is the
4,the fact that a lot
4,there are people who have
4,on the part of government
4,its not going to affect
4,but its not just a
4,rules of the game and
4,is there any way to
4,they look at the data
4,of the fed and the
4,that the head of the
4,and get rid of the
4,a case by case basis
4,rate in the united states
4,we are really talking about
4,whats going on right now
4,be able to get it
4,is such a thing as
4,all of a sudden we
4,it in the context of
4,its kind of like the
4,out a way to make
4,dont you talk about what
4,is the source of the
4,russ im with you there
4,there was a great deal
4,so there is a lot
4,but i think we have
4,if you are not in
4,that there was a lot
4,dont know a lot about
4,in a couple of different
4,of course we dont know
4,i want to get into
4,so all of a sudden
4,way to look at this
4,that weve talked about before
4,we really want to do
4,things that need to be
4,a way to make a
4,willing to pay a lot
4,so i think its important
4,that we were able to
4,and then lets talk about
4,come to that in a
4,chapter in the book on
4,a life of its own
4,are lots and lots of
4,to figure out how you
4,is that it is a
4,we are going to find
4,at that point in time
4,you dont know who you
4,to those of us who
4,russ i was going to
4,most of the time is
4,it but thats not the
4,at the same time that
4,one of the reasons for
4,people who want to make
4,you have a situation where
4,russ and what did you
4,the easiest person to fool
4,so if you are going
4,all kinds of things like
4,to sell something for more
4,one of the reasons they
4,it on the other hand
4,to keep up with the
4,we are living in a
4,for a very long period
4,to end up in the
4,what would you do with
4,it would have been better
4,on the face of it
4,in the local service sector
4,and why are they important
4,to spend other peoples money
4,to make money in the
4,that might be a little
4,could be the case that
4,been going on for a
4,think when you look at
4,when you were talking about
4,it have to do with
4,thing to do is the
4,are your thoughts on the
4,that its hard to do
4,think its a matter of
4,that are going to have
4,way of looking at it
4,and it didnt work and
4,if we are all identical
4,and it turned out that
4,not going to have a
4,in the book i think
4,is that a correct summary
4,is really one of the
4,wrote a book called the
4,was a huge increase in
4,only in the united states
4,going to be different and
4,with that i think its
4,do a pretty good job
4,cents on the dollar because
4,the nuts and bolts of
4,they will be better off
4,the problem of course is
4,well im not going to
4,i would add is that
4,you give the example in
4,have a vested interest in
4,that could be part of
4,whereas in the united states
4,you want to go back
4,if you look at that
4,can do the same thing
4,of the fact that they
4,the book i talk about
4,russ im not so sure
4,you want to try to
4,and i think its important
4,as well but i think
4,good and so i think
4,going to be interesting to
4,that most of the time
4,say if you want to
4,of the harlem childrens zone
4,a lot of time thinking
4,a lot of the work
4,what he wanted to do
4,seem to be able to
4,want to make sure i
4,and a lot of times
4,think it would have been
4,that the people who were
4,you have to pay back
4,the enemy of the good
4,and so we have to
4,but i have to say
4,thing as a free lunch
4,makes a lot of money
4,we dont have the data
4,the same people over time
4,decided they were going to
4,the second world war and
4,who dont go to college
4,the united states at the
4,may turn out to be
4,that the fact that the
4,can do is we can
4,there is kind of a
4,and the answer is no
4,i dont think its the
4,in the labor market and
4,give us some examples of
4,to deal with the fact
4,for a lot of the
4,in the book one of
4,was in the middle of
4,a very important part of
4,its not the same as
4,in the sense that there
4,at least in terms of
4,if you have a very
4,going to see a lot
4,more and more people are
4,how do you find out
4,my response to that is
4,to go back to a
4,prison or jail than are
4,i spent a lot of
4,what do you have in
4,not going to make a
4,is a huge amount of
4,going on in the economy
4,i dont think its that
4,in this day and age
4,think its very difficult to
4,are going to get their
4,something for more than it
4,where they were before the
4,but it turns out that
4,the austrian theory of the
4,equal to the rate of
4,what you are really saying
4,i just dont think that
4,have to pay it back
4,of the labor force and
4,tens of millions of dollars
4,thing or a bad thing
4,russ yeah i agree guest
4,to bring it back to
4,what were going to do
4,of course they are not
4,goes all the way back
4,the cause of the crisis
4,about a lot of things
4,i think there are other
4,the result of that is
4,and you spend a lot
4,not going to have that
4,whats going to happen and
4,at some point it becomes
4,is you dont want to
4,the second half of the
4,in most of the world
4,thats the sense in which
4,if you know you are
4,its the other way around
4,in the world to come
4,so im just going to
4,a lot of things are
4,this is what i think
4,relative to the size of
4,in the book is how
4,and so i think we
4,of whats going on and
4,think of it as something
4,to the interests of the
4,think for a lot of
4,read the road to serfdom
4,the way you look at
4,to try to get a
4,journal of law and economics
4,men how little they know
4,one of the fathers of
4,to be part of a
4,and to some extent the
4,and some of the other
4,and that sort of thing
4,before we move on to
4,and as a result its
4,so lets start with the
4,but what he says is
4,what it does is it
4,we were talking about the
4,the end of the 18th
4,their standard of living is
4,a couple of reasons one
4,bottom half of the distribution
4,of reaction have you gotten
4,is still a lot of
4,need to go back and
4,you are never going to
4,the problem is that you
4,the other thing is i
4,were not going to go
4,we think of it as
4,sherwin rosen and ed lazear
4,and i would like to
4,of gross domestic product gdp
4,intergovernmental panel on climate change
4,that you were talking about
4,the more likely you are
4,are a lot of jobs
4,about the rest of the
4,what you paid for it
4,it a little bit but
4,to come to a group
4,going to be a big
4,you dont know what you
4,be willing to pay for
4,which is a sort of
4,a point in time and
4,was supposed to be the
4,i think they are going
4,most of the time what
4,it a little bit of
4,were going to be talking
4,the middle of the store
4,a lot of room for
4,people who are interested in
4,not the best way to
4,but if you think of
4,the idea that we would
4,to the extent that they
4,to be a very good
4,here at the u of
4,i am not going to
4,those are the kinds of
4,i have no problem with
4,repeal of the corn laws
4,of people in the world
4,incentive to get it right
4,to the point where the
4,they dont want to lose
4,i go to the bank
4,a lot of pressure on
4,years you are going to
4,they are going to work
4,at the same time this
4,in a different way and
4,so you are suggesting that
4,best thing to do is
4,would be a good idea
4,the president has to sign
4,not going to be an
4,not going to be as
4,at 100 cents on the
4,one of the questions i
4,guest well i dont think
4,we are talking about what
4,i think when you look
4,and i want to ask
4,you want to subsidize the
4,how long will it take
4,lot of people have a
4,a lot of people claim
4,top 1 or the top
4,but they are going to
4,to go back into the
4,along the lines of what
4,going to pay a price
4,well come back to this
4,what do they have in
4,economic calculation in the socialist
4,to get into a good
4,i dont know if youve
4,that if you are an
4,i dont know about that
4,it sounds like you are
4,role for the state in
4,go out and buy a
4,more than the market price
4,guest thats right if you
4,so you dont want to
4,didnt know what to do
4,think about it in a
4,government would bail them out
4,are going to be talking
4,which turned out to be
4,the country as a whole
4,dont like the way the
4,based on the fact that
4,of the problems we have
4,if the value of the
4,could go out of business
4,time you get to the
4,of them have to do
4,much more important than the
4,in the midst of a
4,new jersey and new york
4,you are on the left
4,the same as it is
4,thats not the same as
4,if you want to go
4,the root of the problem
4,are they going to do
4,but the interesting thing is
4,and you talk about the
4,get their house in order
4,a lot of people get
4,a very good understanding of
4,to not be able to
4,be a group of people
4,a lot of people they
4,they are supposed to be
4,have an effect on the
4,russ yeah go ahead guest
4,i win tails you lose
4,the way in which you
4,over a period of time
4,me ask you about one
4,growth in the united states
4,have to spend a lot
4,in a very different way
4,were going to be a
4,i agree with that and
4,that on the one hand
4,fact that we have a
4,in the commercial paper market
4,there and a lot of
4,why do you think thats
4,it is the case that
4,that i was going to
4,that you are not going
4,if i understand it correctly
4,because it is such a
4,you go out of business
4,way of thinking about it
4,come back to that because
4,a lot of times you
4,one of the key things
4,there is a set of
4,the discount rate that we
4,some of these things are
4,smiths theory of moral sentiments
4,what do you do about
4,to the united states in
4,people to be able to
4,to make sure that it
4,that i dont think we
4,in a way that would
4,tell us a little bit
4,that that is not the
4,to ask you about the
4,of the economic way of
4,in terms of the number
4,question is what do you
4,to be a great teacher
4,its a lot of money
4,think that there are some
4,theory of moral sentiments tms
4,one of the biggest problems
4,the constitution of liberty he
4,that we really need to
4,you started off by saying
4,but going back to the
4,to get it from the
4,education a lot of people
4,dramatically in the united states
4,very high rates of interest
4,be able to figure out
4,me go back to the
4,the 90th percentile and the
4,your response to that guest
4,there wasnt a lot of
4,that among young black men
4,think thats a lot of
4,that for a lot of
4,a little bit different from
4,whats going on on the
4,do we need to do
4,then at the end of
4,so let me ask a
4,we dont need as many
4,im not sure i would
4,as high as it was
4,that does seem to be
4,so its a little bit
4,do have a lot of
4,talk about that talk about
4,when push comes to shove
4,you are trying to make
4,up with a way to
4,where we are going to
4,going to disagree with you
4,it is true that the
4,if you want to call
4,are doing a good job
4,not be able to do
4,and i think its really
4,that you are looking at
4,are you worried about that
4,first of all its a
4,youve got a lot of
4,in terms of fiscal policy
4,the theory of money and
4,or something like that and
4,the example in the book
4,or some other kind of
4,a chance to talk about
4,that turn out to be
4,all the people who are
4,at about the same time
4,80 million in loans and
4,so where do you think
4,for a couple of reasons
4,this is going to happen
4,is a lot of what
4,of the united states which
4,its always going to be
4,are not the same thing
4,want to know what the
4,a fancy way of saying
4,just to make it clear
4,and when you do that
4,and that was sort of
4,the bottom half of the
4,other countries in the world
4,is the size of the
4,you get what you pay
4,get to the end of
4,the benefit of the doubt
4,who are the people who
4,is the financial sector and
4,turns out there is a
4,but the point is the
4,were going to have a
4,are very different from the
4,dont pay a lot of
4,i think is going to
4,but my point is that
4,we need to create a
4,the next couple of years
4,some time in the future
4,weve been talking about so
4,like to come back to
4,this has to do with
4,it at the market price
4,is a function of the
4,with people who want to
4,a bailout of bear stearns
4,a third of the population
4,had a lot to do
4,than it takes in in
4,there are two types of
4,to make sure that they
4,the same time there are
4,going to be a little
4,that you have to take
4,are going to have less
4,the other side of this
4,we are talking about in
4,a little bit better and
4,the captain of the ship
4,theres a limit to how
4,do you think of the
4,theres no question that the
4,people who dont have a
4,that the bank of england
4,because i think this is
4,and i think that that
4,is not the right word
4,all these kinds of things
4,with the rule of law
4,you dont have to pay
4,is that if you do
4,i wanted to ask you
4,is an example of that
4,the worst thing you can
4,the united states so the
4,are always going to have
4,thats the way it is
4,the way to do it
4,im going to go to
4,be the right way to
4,of the ways in which
4,will turn out to be
4,from the fact that the
4,it used to be but
4,there is a part of
4,the cost of health care
4,have to pay for the
4,that a lot more people
4,im very sympathetic to that
4,the only way to get
4,so when you talk about
4,are going to go up
4,or something like that so
4,gross domestic product gdp or
4,of the points i make
4,i read a lot of
4,i dont want to see
4,are so many things that
4,than it was in the
4,i think its a great
4,people in the world who
4,is that you are not
4,how can it be that
4,are going to go to
4,i think is really important
4,when you are dealing with
4,the idea is that if
4,the low end of the
4,that doesnt seem to be
4,imagine they can design and
4,i do agree with you
4,the first thing is that
4,where there are a lot
4,we dont know what they
4,the other way around so
4,i thought it would be
4,the standard argument is that
4,im not saying we should
4,by the way i think
4,very little to do with
4,a lot of things in
4,that if you are not
4,i want to know if
4,are talking about right now
4,point is that if you
4,of the things we are
4,is to figure out what
4,think about it if you
4,so let me try to
4,i think the fact that
4,but for the most part
4,want to make a distinction
4,as much money as they
4,the united states and so
4,about it all the time
4,so the idea would be
4,is that if you want
4,a lot of them have
4,risk of a heart attack
4,what do we do about
4,it seems to me is
4,you can get out of
4,now if you look at
4,you want to give it
4,what to do with it
4,but lets talk about the
4,as lender of last resort
4,over and over and over
4,and one of the great
4,people move in and out
4,hayeks the road to serfdom
4,and all the other things
4,there are other ways to
4,say it a different way
4,at the end of their
4,it makes more sense to
4,its still the case that
4,and so on i think
4,and i want to talk
4,i think for a lot
4,expense of the rest of
4,from my point of view
4,take it for granted that
4,it was very difficult to
4,i should point out that
4,i think its a really
4,big part of the problem
4,lot of people think they
4,are the two groups that
4,other than the fact that
4,in and out of the
4,isnt enough to go around
4,i dont want to get
4,its true that if you
4,in the book is when
4,you said a minute ago
4,so what are some of
4,there are many countries that
4,hayeks use of knowledge in
4,or in the case of
4,in the united states had
4,they know and dont know
4,a very different kind of
4,the harlem childrens zone which
4,for a long time but
4,in a way that doesnt
4,agree with a lot of
4,to spend more time with
4,things you are talking about
4,the most out of life
4,a number of people have
4,in favor of free trade
4,you are going to give
4,of a sudden you have
4,one of the keys to
4,if you go into a
4,when i looked at the
4,are talking about here is
4,the point you are making
4,very very long time and
4,were going to run out
4,we dont need to worry
4,think one of the most
4,what it takes to be
4,pay for it out of
4,the goods and services that
4,let me put it this
4,and so on and they
4,to buy a house and
4,a different way of saying
4,a high school degree and
4,are going to continue to
4,theres a lot of other
4,guest the fact that the
4,of the small band or
4,in the united states certainly
4,are going to go back
4,the balance sheets of the
4,the end of the summer
4,if its going to be
4,a lot of people from
4,united states off the gold
4,to know how to do
4,the most important part of
4,you are the easiest person
4,the height of the financial
4,the other part of that
4,ought to be able to
4,we are in the middle
4,they are going to try
4,the beginning of the 20th
4,dont put all your eggs
4,to your point about the
4,one of the challenges is
4,going to talk about today
4,i think that that is
4,myth of the rational voter
4,and its a little bit
4,evidence do we have that
4,aspect of your immune system
4,you have to rely on
4,it up a little bit
4,on the wrong side of
4,those of you out there
4,and get your reaction to
4,the way to do that
4,give the example in the
4,the other hand you have
4,what we do is we
4,of the things you learn
4,you have a feel for
4,are probably not going to
4,people are worried about the
4,once you start thinking about
4,a lot in the book
4,only one social science and
4,if you are doing a
4,one of the characteristics of
4,how do you reconcile that
4,dont know what the right
4,a couple of years and
4,you are part of this
4,about that in a minute
4,me ask it a different
4,and filling them back in
4,but i dont think they
4,wouldnt be able to do
4,is not doing very well
4,the united states russ and
4,the front of the store
4,the fable of the bees
4,i think thats the kind
4,russ why do you think
4,question as to whether or
4,in and of itself russ
4,you think you are going
4,have the same kind of
4,in the absence of a
4,to pay for it but
4,that would allow them to
4,the last 50 years is
4,that thats not going to
4,going to have a little
4,quite a bit in the
4,sell it for more than
4,that all of a sudden
4,a million and a half
4,increase in the demand for
4,and to the extent that
4,is something that a lot
4,to pay the cost of
4,the left or the right
4,talk about why you think
4,do you think is the
4,because of the lack of
4,do you think we ought
4,so you are talking about
4,of the business cycle the
4,and most of the time
4,were not going to have
4,there are so many things
4,that the whole thing is
4,in the great depression that
4,up by a factor of
4,an inquiry into the nature
4,a long time there was
4,are the ones that are
4,go on a casebycase basis
4,the last 20 years and
4,some of them will have
4,they wont be able to
4,which is kind of a
4,you can come up with
4,and thats what i think
4,i dont have the exact
4,a lot in terms of
4,are going to be higher
4,to do with it its
4,it doesnt matter what you
4,thats why you have to
4,want to make sure the
4,parts of the world and
4,i think is very important
4,that in a minute but
4,think one of the great
4,between the united states and
4,but it turns out to
4,is part of the story
4,if you think you are
4,of the 18th century and
4,it and i think that
4,make a lot of people
4,put all your eggs in
4,that its not going to
4,can be thought of as
4,to keep in mind and
4,risks for the sake of
4,what im talking about is
4,the challenge is how do
4,of the things is that
4,to come back to your
4,between the individual and the
4,write about in the book
4,so i just want to
4,for the benefit of the
4,the best interest of the
4,i have a little bit
4,and i want to come
4,its certainly true that the
4,what i would say is
4,we were going to do
4,putting that to the side
4,international monetary fund imf and
4,when i was in graduate
4,the last 10 or 15
4,the last thing i want
4,but thats part of the
4,you think we are going
4,well come to that in
4,between the state and the
4,part of what we are
4,think thats the kind of
4,you can see it in
4,if you can get a
4,some people are going to
4,a lot of problems that
4,the things that i think
4,is that we want to
4,one thing that struck me
4,have a lot of money
4,at the low end of
4,terms of the business cycle
4,a lot of people but
4,that there is such a
4,but when you look at
4,it turns out there are
4,what do i mean by
4,i think it could be
4,is a lot of stuff
4,look at whats happened to
4,what we really want to
4,are going to have trouble
4,you have to have some
4,so in that sense im
4,and your point is that
4,people who go to college
4,most of the time guest
4,a place where there is
4,are going to be more
4,have a very good understanding
4,the manipulation of money and
4,about a third of the
4,would you do if you
4,you think about it there
4,and then were going to
4,is the same thing as
4,and i think it is
4,whether we are going to
4,of the great things about
4,the ideas in the book
4,lot of time talking about
4,anything to do with the
4,is that many of these
4,countries like the united states
4,and then you think about
4,advantage of the fact that
4,going to come back and
4,was going to be the
4,to the value of the
4,at the time this was
4,of supply and demand and
4,so at the end of
4,if you want to change
4,you have to find a
4,things going on in the
4,all the other things that
4,effect of winning the lottery
4,yourself and you are the
4,what they did was they
4,over and over again in
4,one of my favorite lines
4,well i think thats right
4,and i think its not
4,how much of it was
4,you can do is to
4,and the reason they are
4,take a look at this
4,but thats the way it
4,but thats not what happens
4,weve just been talking about
4,people who were in the
4,that they are able to
4,i have no idea what
4,what would happen to the
4,of them are going to
4,that correct guest thats right
4,of it but i think
4,and you are the easiest
4,a lot of talk about
4,so far as to say
4,going to put you in
4,the answer to your question
4,let me see if i
4,but i want to get
4,i dont know what it
4,no one is in charge
4,at whats going on in
4,it the problem is that
4,russ lets turn to the
4,they are going to say
4,all the things that we
4,if you are not going
4,led by an invisible hand
4,dont want to think about
4,and so you have a
4,up the price of housing
4,to do with it and
4,but i want to go
4,to sell it at the
4,have to take that into
4,if i said to you
4,sector in the united states
4,they dont have to do
4,i dont agree with that
4,and if you are the
4,you lose a lot of
4,think one of the biggest
4,who are not going to
4,a little more about the
4,very long period of time
4,the fact that if they
4,we have to do it
4,market in the united states
4,of our present difficulty is
4,the united states off the
4,the second part of the
4,out in the united states
4,how to do that and
4,what we know about the
4,but you are talking about
4,to be able to tell
4,the last half of the
4,but they dont have to
4,only a matter of time
4,i hope we can get
4,but im not sure that
4,the world at the time
4,that many of the things
4,a lot of people on
4,the end of the century
4,live in the washington dc
4,so a lot of the
4,today is your book the
4,what it used to be
4,the book is about the
4,in the next 20 years
4,and so what happens is
4,of the bush tax cuts
4,the first thing i would
4,very clearly in the data
4,is that there is an
4,you may be able to
4,of the savings and loan
4,maybe well come back to
4,in the last three years
4,cause of the great depression
4,from the international monetary fund
4,the rest of the year
4,think the problem is that
4,there is an increase in
4,is that a fair summary
4,to come to an end
4,you are going to ask
4,you are going to die
4,think that there is a
4,does it mean to say
4,i think that there are
4,seems to me that if
4,it comes down to is
4,that we see in the
4,come to a group of
4,you are really going to
4,have an impact on the
4,how to get the most
4,a hundred years from now
4,have no problem with the
4,i think the evidence is
4,so many things that we
4,russ fair enough guest and
4,to be a lot more
4,that that would be a
4,unlikely to be able to
4,in the united states particularly
4,to make a distinction between
4,russ and what do you
4,of the last 30 years
4,by the way when you
4,so i do think that
4,with a lot of people
4,calculation in the socialist commonwealth
4,might not be the same
4,but thats a different story
4,and then the third thing
4,but it may not be
4,was a guest on this
4,than they would be if
4,that would allow us to
4,not turn out to be
4,and what i say is
4,and figure out how to
4,the repeal of glasssteagall and
4,the total amount of the
4,thats not a very good
4,the question is what is
4,be an interesting thing to
4,even if there is no
4,that monetary policy has been
4,the time it takes to
4,the world was coming to
4,i think its a little
4,its not quite the same
4,taxes are going to be
4,about it a little bit
4,in the late 1980s early
4,to do is to get
4,im not so worried about
4,there are parts of the
4,and so i think its
4,i think the more important
4,so this is kind of
4,so on and i think
4,is that a correct way
4,not a good time to
4,even though it might be
4,the opposite of the way
4,and then there is this
4,like you to talk about
4,we dont want them to
4,im a little more optimistic
4,go ahead guest so the
4,to what it was in
4,turned out to be quite
4,hard to get out of
4,we can come up with
4,was a guest on econtalk
4,the aftermath of the 2008
4,guest i think its a
4,the other point i want
4,that i think one of
4,where is the evidence that
4,and i do think that
4,which by the way is
4,that it was going to
4,not going to work and
4,as you said its a
4,of people who dont like
4,is if you are going
4,what would happen if we
4,recessions in the united states
4,make a long story short
4,60 votes in the senate
4,it used to be a
4,you have to go through
4,want to make sure you
4,russ and do you think
4,and i dont think thats
4,the path of least resistance
4,this is where i think
4,you dont really want to
4,how to make it work
4,make it easier for people
4,total spending in the economy
4,if you think about how
4,that we dont have to
4,our present difficulty is that
4,to have an impact on
4,about the fact that there
4,not going to get any
4,you dont want to have
4,why do you want to
4,the problem the problem is
4,a lot more money than
4,of the 20th century was
4,that there are many things
4,of course there are a
4,i dont have any problem
4,the best they can do
4,going to happen to the
4,is a lot less than
4,the last thing you want
4,for 20 shillings a bushel
4,to figure out a way
4,the growth of the economy
4,you have a system that
4,lack of a better word
4,take risks for the sake
4,of the things you see
4,the aftermath of the crisis
4,going to come up with
4,is a good thing in
4,have a good sense of
4,but putting that to the
4,to the extent that it
4,so as you point out
4,the case of fannie and
4,you have skin in the
4,are a bunch of things
4,are going to have some
4,be a good thing to
4,we dont want to be
4,to be done i think
4,the other hand i think
4,there is a lot more
4,have a stake in it
4,the value of the assets
4,you have to keep the
4,terms of the number of
4,at the front of the
4,top of the income distribution
4,so what you end up
4,mae and freddie mac and
4,a little bit but i
4,know anything about that guest
4,the united states that we
4,obvious to me that the
4,and if you are going
4,that i am going to
4,you would expect to see
4,to a group of people
4,out of the labor market
4,of people in the united
4,they made a lot of
4,in the right direction but
4,have to give up something
4,propensity to truck barter and
4,the united states they are
4,russ what does that mean
4,i think the bottom line
4,what has happened to the
4,the idea that you are
4,he was onto something there
4,because one of the things
4,for a long time that
4,to come up with an
4,russ do you think we
4,because its not going to
4,the journal of economic perspectives
4,going to be in a
4,i dont disagree with you
4,and what are some of
4,the second thing is that
4,that there would be no
4,point of view of a
4,do all kinds of things
4,i think youd be hardpressed
4,whats the evidence that this
4,the sort of thing i
4,you put a tax on
4,i was going to ask
4,get in the way of
4,thats not what we are
4,of the 1980s and 1990s
4,and when you are done
4,a better way to do
4,we have a bunch of
4,now part of that is
4,correlation between population density and
4,and i think there is
4,the united states guest well
4,guest thats right and i
4,russ well im going to
4,be able to do something
4,have to be a little
4,the people who were in
4,world that we live in
4,the sort of thing that
4,just want to mention to
4,is very different from the
4,give us some of the
4,the great depression as well
4,weve talked about many times
4,have to pay attention to
4,dont know if its true
4,to raise the debt limit
4,i think this is what
4,policy on the part of
4,of the problems with that
4,funded out of current taxes
4,you see this in the
4,lot of stuff in the
4,i think thats the way
4,i think most of us
4,states off the gold standard
4,trying to do is to
4,and i think its very
4,they spend a lot of
4,and one of them is
4,to make the point that
4,it is part of the
4,it at the same time
4,not just that they dont
4,great depression of the 1930s
4,the things you need to
4,talk about the people who
4,the late 1980s early 1990s
4,we are going to use
4,in a very specific way
4,of the things he says
4,so it doesnt really matter
4,to the fact that the
4,more people are going to
4,were one of the first
4,one of my favorite stories
4,to think about it and
4,of the millennium villages project
4,out of the goodness of
4,thought we were going to
4,many ways in which they
4,what its like to be
4,in front of me but
4,lot of what you are
4,so if you have an
4,an extended period of time
4,is going to come to
4,why do you think it
4,present difficulty is that we
4,know what to do and
4,person is going to be
4,the be all and end
4,in the economy and the
4,then you are going to
4,to make sure they dont
4,the quantity theory of money
4,one of the reasons is
4,go out and spend it
4,lets move on to some
4,about it and i think
4,and our standard of living
4,scholar of the great depression
4,and the other is that
4,was part of the reason
4,and what are they doing
4,you are going to need
4,skin in the game if
4,height of the financial crisis
4,you are not in the
4,thats where the money is
4,for lack of a better
4,im going to talk about
4,so you end up with
4,of the constitution of liberty
4,we are going to take
4,so let me ask you
4,certain amount of money and
4,i dont think we need
4,there has never been a
4,most if not all of
4,we are more likely to
4,i dont want you to
4,you are saying that because
4,have to take into account
4,it would be wrong for
4,they are not very good
4,those of us who have
4,do you think we stand
4,that are very hard to
4,then the question is why
4,and it turns out they
4,of gdp gross domestic product
4,one of the implications of
4,are always going to be
4,going on in the united
4,those are the kind of
4,is going to get a
4,a little bit and then
4,to pay a lot of
4,it in the book but
4,i dont think it has
4,it so i want to
4,end of the 18th century
4,of the things we have
4,have to go to the
4,if you give them a
4,just not going to be
4,you look at the world
4,is the way it is
4,dont know if you want
4,but on the other side
4,is that there are many
4,think its one of the
4,it hard for people to
4,willing to pay for it
4,we would be able to
4,i think were going to
4,i agree with you so
4,i wrote a book called
4,has to do with a
4,which is what we are
4,the mess we are in
4,is paying interest on reserves
4,to me that we are
4,but it could be that
4,im not a fan of
4,you get to a point
4,one of the examples you
4,russ so what do you
4,its not as if the
4,russ so im going to
4,what do you think guest
4,well if you look at
4,do you think you are
4,theres going to be some
4,a little bit about what
4,look at some of the
4,the first year of the
4,do you think that was
4,that in a way that
4,the idea that they are
4,of the interesting things about
4,look at the big picture
4,out how to make it
4,how do you explain that
4,the more important point is
4,part of it i think
4,in the first part of
4,at the university of chicago
4,the whole thing is a
4,that guest well first of
4,skin in the game is
4,well i agree with that
4,you are interested in the
4,the top of the income
4,have to figure it out
4,i think its an interesting
4,to get back to a
4,intro recording date july 27
4,you think are the most
4,because when you look at
4,part of our present difficulty
4,in the late 1980s and
4,tell them what to do
4,such thing as a free
4,the people who work at
4,to look at the world
4,number of people in the
4,a very large number of
4,the case that if you
4,of people are going to
4,they dont have to worry
4,it would have been to
4,of it as something that
4,you look for example at
4,of course there are many
4,talked about this before but
4,think thats going to happen
4,million dollars a year and
4,in the bottom half of
4,yeah i dont know if
4,im going to give a
4,it a lot harder to
4,you can do it with
4,that is not the case
4,national bureau of economic research
4,in the last 510 years
4,the game of bank bargains
4,even if they are not
4,i dont think they were
4,along the lines of the
4,im with you on that
4,you cant just look at
4,whose job it is to
4,these people are going to
4,it but a lot of
4,increase in the size of
4,a lot of it was
4,think there will be a
4,i have to be careful
4,a short period of time
4,to mention by the way
4,its not a big deal
4,so just to take an
4,a lot of the same
4,there is i think a
4,so first of all i
4,a lot more of that
4,the financial crisis of 2008
4,of the problems with this
4,is a lot of uncertainty
4,in the same way you
4,some of the things you
4,best alternative to a negotiated
4,so in the united states
4,and i think thats true
4,but my guess is that
4,i think its very interesting
4,what you can do with
4,over the last 10 years
4,the united states and what
4,both in the united states
4,there is a group of
4,do a lot of things
4,lets talk about the people
4,go back to adam smith
4,and the rest of us
4,so why dont you talk
4,there is a big difference
4,that a lot of economists
4,the book and i think
4,how could it be that
4,things going on at the
4,me a long time to
4,to use the price system
4,give you a sense of
4,in a situation where you
4,figure out what the right
4,to take advantage of that
4,and this is where i
4,went back and looked at
4,what i am saying is
4,you have to ask what
4,he spent a lot of
4,so i think thats the
4,look at what they do
4,thought it was going to
4,do you think guest well
4,its not going to get
4,russ i totally agree guest
4,what used to be the
4,thats a good point guest
4,the difference between the two
4,all kinds of things that
4,that you dont have a
4,want to give you a
4,balance sheet of the fed
4,of the bank of england
4,the fair trade movement is
4,going to be affected by
4,i dont mean to suggest
4,to a bunch of people
4,weve talked about before on
4,that most of the people
4,have a great deal of
4,in the united states now
4,going back to the 19th
4,that a correct way to
4,back to this issue of
4,its nice to have a
4,the question i want to
4,which i think is the
4,way to solve the problem
4,first of all this is
4,that i think there are
4,be the case that the
4,sympathetic to the idea that
4,want their kids to be
4,i do think it is
4,about some of the other
4,a lot of money they
4,let me tell you the
4,do you think the fed
4,talk about that in the
4,is a bit of a
4,i want to get your
4,be all and end all
4,it turns out they are
4,what he meant by that
4,the united states compared to
4,of the economy at the
4,this happens all the time
4,to do something about the
4,a lot of people like
4,up to the level of
4,are getting a lot of
4,and what you think is
4,got to figure out how
4,there for a long time
4,we have the same problem
4,turns out to be one
4,if you get rid of
4,theres an enormous amount of
4,its not so much the
4,is what is going to
4,to truck barter and exchange
4,a small amount of money
4,other things that are going
4,it would be interesting to
4,theres no doubt about it
4,income in the united states
4,for the fed to do
4,you are not careful you
4,had to do with a
4,to be in favor of
4,the value of your assets
4,are the easiest person to
4,russ i want to talk
4,there has to be something
4,it may be that the
4,the middle of the 19th
4,but it was a very
4,because it seems to me
4,the balance sheet of the
4,on the rest of the
4,a little hard to believe
4,as much as i could
4,going to get into the
4,all your eggs in one
4,have a pretty good idea
4,at least a little bit
4,where did that come from
4,in the quality of life
4,that there could be a
4,they do it in a
4,will never be the same
4,russ thats a great point
4,and were not going to
4,and the funny thing is
4,no no no no no
4,the bottom line is that
4,the rest of it and
4,want to ask you a
4,russ and by the way
4,the top 1 or the
4,are going to pay for
4,of the matter is that
4,that i dont have a
4,are willing to pay more
4,first of all let me
4,that but i do think
4,to try to get the
4,the point is that in
4,you have to go back
4,stand in the way of
4,to make a long story
4,guest im not sure i
4,how much time do you
4,you want to be able
4,not the same as a
4,so its not just that
4,a link up to that
4,a good thing or a
4,in the 1960s or 1970s
4,can teach people to be
4,in the short run but
4,russ one of the things
4,spending a lot of money
4,do you think that has
4,when you actually look at
4,too good to be true
4,i think you said the
4,we can teach people to
4,poor people around the world
4,the private sector is not
4,were going to do something
4,lot of uncertainty about what
4,do we have any idea
4,what they were trying to
4,for those who want to
4,russ say that again guest
4,money back 100 cents on
4,on that guest well i
4,that there is going to
4,know what to do with
4,over the life of the
4,interest rates fall to zero
4,how to do it very
4,think you are right that
4,thats just the way it
4,earned income tax credit or
4,not just a matter of
4,i think its worse than
4,somebody would have picked it
4,pushing up the demand for
4,think about it as a
4,people who dont like the
4,in many of these countries
4,we can do better than
4,fda food and drug administration
4,because at the end of
4,to get access to the
4,take a lot of time
4,a very high level of
4,structured in advance of experience
4,that doesnt get talked about
4,that i dont think the
4,that the private sector is
4,we know thats not true
4,and i think we know
4,the organization for economic cooperation
4,its more than that i
4,i think that they are
4,i could go on and
4,what we can say is
4,pay a price for that
4,well be able to do
4,in the book that you
4,all over the world they
4,obviously theres a lot of
4,do the same thing to
4,clause of the 14th amendment
4,it could be a lot
4,figured out a way to
4,any one point in time
4,a better way to say
4,live in a society where
4,think about in terms of
4,like the united states and
4,on the shoulders of giants
4,about in the book and
4,you think thats a good
4,very hard to figure out
4,its a question of who
4,start by talking about the
4,to come back to this
4,i dont know how many
4,what is the impact of
4,a lot of reasons for
4,out of the 18th century
4,to do is the thing
4,a very short period of
4,are very much in the
4,saying is that if you
4,that would be a very
4,thats the sort of thing
