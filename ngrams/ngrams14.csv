1,system is pretty good at dealing with trial and error that way but i
1,you want to make a lot more rather than less but one of the
1,one of the things they do if we were bigger we could have crop
1,of a 90story building and getting ready to jump hed have 20 sycophants and
1,as not stalin stalin was a murderer of enormous proportions one of the one
1,is how you mechanically go about logistically correcting the actual numbers so you said
1,money at all thats the incentive part of innocentive russ what was the problem

1,tempted to let us slowly unspin the story the way it does in the
1,as well so it fails on both those tests whichever one you choose to
1,are binary in the sense that binary can take a 0 or 1 the
1,smith tries to do the same with experiments to make it possible to relate
1,with education health and nutrition makes a difference is school quality an important determinant
1,if you were very poor and so this was a deal on the surface
1,bulletin board but the padre had business eventually yes but you want to pick
1,has regulation demonstrably reduced the risks sorting out wealth effects vs regulation effects is
1,keynes and his interaction with the bankers and cronies is not a suggestion that
1,you think about this and why you are more sanguine about the consequences than
1,the way that they generally think they do russ and what would be your
1,not holding them back correct at least not the biggest firms no but thats
1,sure is different from yours is that we are not close to a position
1,you know russ thats true but i do see it as a public choice
1,consortium of christian churches which is officially recognized and its a pretty tame church
1,exercise and the obese twins its hard to believe they just had a different

1,numbers are better than no numbers its better to do a very stripped down
1,not thought about which is we are encouraged to plan planning is good everybody
1,but were not close to being done with those adjustments now with state budgets
1,interviewed him for econtalk in 2006 shortly before he died guest yeah yeah i
1,these decisions that we make at the policy level and its interesting to me
1,to realize that opportunity addressing research that challenges the size of those estimates and
1,is economists saying oh yeah the banks are as bad off as they were
1,thats the second story first diversification they also diversify across consumer needs you may
1,what you dont know which is like what the producer doesnt know what the
1,a great point you are making this is worth pointing out that the big
1,code that you are born to often determines the scholastic outcome the school you
1,and things would inevitably go wrong the first time certainly maybe every time for
1,the krugman criticismand hes not alone of course many people have argued that because
1,what hes doing because hes trying to get across not a normative argument but
1,somewhat trivial but maybe its symptomatic of the problem in general my doctor and
1,population of less than 5 of people in the united states who dont have
1,get a fresh look schumpeter was able to do this perhaps his having moved
1,of ancient paperlike stuff um so guest yes so anyway russ hang on my
1,the euro period its over what information did that failed auction as some have
1,be interesting because its often claimed that one of the things that happened in
1,adjusts population bomb julian simon bet technology adjusted food prices ten years right time
1,productive yes the few people who remain are better off making higher wages relatively
1,based on individual rights or a system based on technocrats and dictators and there

1,20 years ago or 10 years ago or certainly today so we have here
1,cartelizing policies that made the demand for highly talented people less acute not a

1,argument would be well if i give the state the power to tax people
1,the south the midwest texas oklahoma and i think there will be a much
1,confusion that you kind of hinted at and you almost slipped into saying hold
1,a measure of money that was importantbut measuring what that is has been difficult
1,services and furthermore its been widely publicized that the promises that the federal government
1,of the measurement at all do you think those effects are small not important

1,they have have the result of bringing a knife to a gunfight they are
1,or bus to hospital that may be far away proud to show what is
1,was not aesthetic the mac appealed to me classic 1984 commercial that aired during

1,system of low tariffs but klings pointed out that we should lose the we
1,tend to run the show appearances aside regional bank presidents do not have all
1,zero russ thats true guest so you cant tell a story based on leverage
1,so one story would be they were disappointed with the outcome of the policy
1,all your eggs in one basket actually id say two things dont put all
1,like the way king farouk might have treated a waiter not much respect thought
1,purchasing power parity us vs european success in the future canada unemployment rates vs

1,as many people want to live there as want to live in queens and
1,you screw around with money you screw around with goods because you get relative
1,could never get by russ are you suggesting that there can be negative campaigning
1,this myth was promulgated by profdr historians economists began to reject it at some
1,americans were running in debt and by 1877 concerned that americans were borrowing trouble
1,the novelty love the adventure so it seems to me though that that love
1,inequality issues increasing amounts of aid to the pooreducational quality parks nutritionhas to have
1,frank by international standards we have a very small public sector it has grown
1,cause the banks to increase their supply of loans which will increase the supply
1,and how has that changed in the last ten years guest oh wow its
1,in new jersey cant buy insurance from people in pennsylvania even though its right
1,this also applies outside math in ways that probably arent intuitive to all of
1,for the recordis not the producer or even worse case where both of us
1,now it was offset by the fact that a lot of money went in
1,be false but it was said to be true hard to believe sad music
1,coming to you we are taking all your planes guest to hell with the
1,dont disprove the claim smithian way to look at it confirmation bias sowell framework
1,empirical data so his methodology i would say is an attempt to say that
1,last example is an unbelievable is a perfect example lets pretend they had found
1,payments to the states and 13 on various socalled expansionary activities of various kinds
1,also happen in any industry where there is innovation take the fed out of
1,the major purchases by the fed of mortgagebacked securities thats blown their balance sheet
1,well economics is good when you talk about banking or setting up a business
1,yes bob frank first introduced that phrase i believe in 1988 in the book
1,whoever happens to be the top male and in human history the same sorts
1,this before but this moment really crystalizes it for meits called doddfrank of all
1,take certain kinds of financial instruments which would be much too risky if concentrated
1,through with government assistance in any case that was not forthcoming government wound up
1,right and wrong take a shot at it theres a long list of things
1,dont have any guilt you dont have that and people start having these conflicts
1,divided into three parts the first part is basically about so i have three
1,happen in a company that is far away from an urban center it can
1,every year from flu in the united states many other vaccines crucial and important
1,can challenge it but what you show is that its actually flat theres been
1,15 i misspoke he got a year older while we were doing the podcastbut
1,expectations that will affect interest rates turn it aroundall international banks think they can
1,they find it lucrative to respond with bigger production not doing that now they
1,wifi here or russ refresh this pagetheres a little marker guest exactly russ but
1,in a way that 50 years agobecause there was no researchin a way that
1,its always good to take another crack at that issue there is nothing at
1,freddie they would always have the disclaimer that nothing about fannie and freddie the
1,is the most powerful one probably if they could that would be politically controversial
1,a terrible idea in principle trying to raise prices and wages at the same
1,are talking still things that are not out of historical precedence certainly we are
1,would show up as the result of a gene or biochemical problem but turns
1,from one kind of student to another kind of student and thats ultimately not
1,its not that tms lays out what is moral vague mysterious wherein morality propriety
1,experience the american high school experience to be replaced by something thats different im
1,and that one way or another we are going to end up getting blamed
1,days a year pretend there is a we if im thirsty and buy water
1,forget is reading that all the local sheiks came to his funeral because he
1,actually learned a lot of the key insights its just people are never that
1,because of their public socalled public systems not only do they try to institute
1,an environmental crisis over the last half century which most people agree is therebut
1,good at compliance they are really good at fda testing and they have something
1,higher than negative payoffs if god doesnt exist had to also assume that god
1,the complexity of society in general so again i would distinguish that complexitysimplicity axis
1,perhaps combined with safety net ex ante fairness credit rating agencies going in opposite
1,have this obligation to my friend its like aa right i work harder to
1,are moving down ensuring that we minimize transaction costs associated with national borders and
1,are in the wrong universe buddy russ lets talk about education a little bit
1,i think you absolutely would learn to play it eventually but i think it
1,3853 logistics water electricity book online water evaporation desalination power at beginning mainly diesel
1,its own but it could use some help but they were too optimistic i
1,on that but the denominator of that is always riskweighted assets and so the
1,of the ability of anybody to put together the mortgages that have been broken
1,terrible intellectual mistake you suggest as do many that the standard of living for
1,thats the mostthe statin drug class is the most successful drug class in the
1,transition took placeyou could argue there was a test a choicesmall bookstore or large
1,they had never engaged with each other because there was this sort of strange
1,a house im thinking about the person who convinces somebody to take out a
1,them were kind of on the edges of being on the fringes of mainstream
1,the economy thats what happens thats what happens in the culture when these ideas
1,people and let them buy lets say something like cereal or preferably something more
1,ehrlichs side in the bet russ you have a fabulous chart in the book
1,your kids say how long till we get there well were still going backwards
1,government is in a position to set up these contests where the value they
1,why do we have the particular bankruptcy system we have as opposed to bankruptcy
1,that 20012004 even now extremely low real rates of interest fed had deflation dread
1,understood that the government will save them whenever in trouble and rubin was also
1,better than the placebos conclusion drawn is that antidepressants dont work and really what
1,are fewer unappropriated rents sloshing out there for political activists to get so what
1,inconceivable that we will do away with testbased accountability parents like it its been
1,to whom is always the question some people are calling the book pessimistic but
1,have made no progress on average since 1970 1975 1974 1979i was alive then
1,combine things at first then think of more complicated things this leads to the
1,he would say he would contrast his theory of regulation with what he would
1,can say thats as strange as reality they put mirrors as russ just said
1,to that because you have some interesting things to say about it but i
1,would you need it but my view is if you want to hear the
1,1987 crash lots of explanations anecdotal to blame it on portfolio insurance grasping at
1,the solvency of the institution before the regulators slapped on a multiplier didnt ask
1,wasnt just britain that was losing gold but other countries as well france was
1,steve bartkowski in early 1977 bought me a plane ticket i flew to atlanta
1,occurs in ordinary conversations while you are walking down the hall or while you
1,in that free market price which is an objective measure of value and from
1,progressive volstead act was pages long not written by wayne b wheeler but he
1,government underneath that would be like a state you are suggesting that we need
1,but when we think about consumers going into debt to raise their standard of
1,is within reach of a large number of people and then second is even
1,for the last 3040 years has looked at business cycle theory go through a
1,lot easier to measure in the bitcoin world because everything is controlled by this
1,moneyand its not specific the problem with saving is im thinking about spending this
1,the time is obesity is a complicated multifactorial disease and if i argue that
1,is just a restatement in a lot of ways even more eloquent than the
1,work on that scale now its not something you want to rush into transit
1,for the new growth rate because these increases in doubling times have in fact
1,the temptation to get overly worked up about it at least it seems that
1,hiding proprietary trades in the cio office thats possibly true i would give that
1,it is almost an embarrassing question because people have a lot of trouble making
1,the parasites have been with us forever they are actually benign and then you
1,parrots that is an issue of geologic time worry about the arc of the
1,politically plausible they are the heart of our policy recommendation is just outright deregulation
1,this was for the whole population so that mixing in people who you wouldnt
1,think wow there are problems in the subprime market yeah thats true its a
1,certainly in economic policy excuse methey tend to i think there is a problem
1,in that situation you are suggesting and i think a lot of people would
1,that slice of a vertical stack do that to perfection standard view of that
1,his manager tells him to do and depends on walks because a walk is
1,some people saywell a forprofit company tax deductible well theres a difference between tax
1,a lot of money baseball players too people do get mad about it nobody
1,thats okay thats not bad thats not a failing thats not something to fix
1,the sl crisis in the late 1970s even friedman and schwartz thought to be
1,market bubble that pops systemic effects or that it may have had some bubbly
1,it also just thinking about it forces you to confront the fact that theres
1,motto ladies and gentlemen serving ladies and gentlemen memorable only so many things can
1,into it later how do you find when you are involved day to day
1,now i want to talk about creating a positive dynamic of progress so im
1,and theres one other state so in the swing states obama maintains a lead
1,at this interface between what i would call effectiveness and ethics i had a
1,will naturally tend to listen to ones that they agree with and there are
1,my books i realized that actually this was a hypothesis and it was a
1,top 5 10 and we were able to show that for the 9095th percentile
1,them if raised in china not the norm of lines people just crush in
1,general make a very convincing moral case do you think thats true guest absolutely
1,obama administration were actually all part of the committee to save the world during
1,particular quarter when i survey you and highincome highproductivity folksnot the same thingbut people
1,the hope of getting a baby and with that increased risk of multiple gestations
1,usually selfconfidence is a flaw unless you are right so well get to that
1,that you can imagine growth is the cause and an increase in intake of
1,to supreme court 54 majority of the court finally said that it was important
1,you just presume you are going to do x just because everybody does that
1,want to pay for it but a lot of people want to enjoy the
1,you with your life people give answers that are consistent and interpretable russ later
1,intense desire on the one hand of parents to have their kids be quasiprofessionalized
1,better on it even in the absence of any economic incentives no doubt about
1,you do science and the pressures on what you can get published certainly you
1,turned down by some of the developing countries but the reason why i am
1,because agriculture is just much harder for division of labor the big source of
1,of scale if you take away the economies of scale you take away many
1,are going to wipe out peoples savings in such a world would not people
1,million views on youtube knew record was destined to go to number 1 artists
1,so again we say why arent those trades taking place well something almost by
1,it may be a drugrelated offense and they may receive drug treatment as sort
1,western northern europe than in 1950 thats not correcting for population growth thats just
1,were positive casey mulligan on this program argued that we changed all kinds of
1,and you make the choice moral choice when you do the tough thing in
1,people to certain stimuli whether its words or pictures then it affects their behavior
1,always set policy such that nominal gdp is expected to grow at the target
1,i think thats a good goal can balance the budget without raising taxes so
1,aig would have gone under all these maybe goldman sachs as a result other
1,word with and my definition is a stoic is someone who transforms fear into
1,work you have done the two of you together in this area and where
1,were doing back up you need something like the uschinesetaiwanese issue to make any
1,minutes from portland which is the biggest city in maine and its kind of
1,starting to take place in the 1970s i was at new york university nyu
1,the fascinating things about the book that i really enjoyed theres this famous dialog
1,is absolutely true modern technology allows us to actually engage in transactions that before
1,its just something weird that you did or unusual that you did this is
1,highly renowned its been highly cited thousands of times its there in most of
1,doing russ roberts in the stimulus bill blumberg yeah russ roberts i dont have
1,private sector and so we see that in military contracting military contractors most of
1,hurt nonfair trade farmers it seems to me the bigger problem is the competition
1,involuntary obviously its not ideal change of all kinds puts people in situations where
1,schwartzcould have averted it deeper point if we didnt have fractional reserve banking and
1,we like him why dont we just focus on discouraging bad things instead of
1,economy might be in a recessionand as we know now we were in a
1,yeah and thats a good teaching practice put something in your own words something
1,whole manufacturing process it is now no longer the bottleneck its one of the
1,where they can do the least harm why would you think the manager knows
1,inflation goal doesnt mean you have to have coordination of monetary policy 2323 role
1,have too much skin in the game and i dont think you deal with
1,back to any of those four guest no actually merton was incredible he had
1,done a better job of creating more roads to a high school work force
1,the short term pressures are so intensethe pressures of partisan politics which on the
1,with the stimulus package hopeful message keeps selling idea that fiscal policyplaying around with
1,dont agree with they were crucial we had no choice we were standing on
1,the epilogue to law legislation and liberty whole elements of that are clearly there
1,me is i dont think our brains are very welldesigned for thinking about or
1,so cass sunstein from whom much of this argument comes russ hes been a
1,while back pointed out that the gdp numbersthe per capita income numbersarent reliable so
1,should be is an attempt to get the most out of what someones gifts
1,i have a chapter in this book about the california energy crisis russ book
