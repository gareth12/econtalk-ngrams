1,sound for us to be able to use to make money and as you said their results were very dispiriting one of the studies
1,sovereign debt sovereign debt meaning issued by countries rather than companies we dont know how much sovereign debt is held by these european and
1,the great depression but the shadow banking system and role of leverage and how that worked its way through the housing market caught most
1,is in the country and they had as steve pointed out earlier very particular risks too they couldnt diversify across regions so the united

1,again is a nice example of your opposite the opposite of proactive isnt reactive its doing nothing its passive doing nothing letting things happen
1,i was there the village still had no running water or electricity or paved roads there were no industries or longterm jobs or anything

1,think wed all be happy if we had our own jet there are different ways to think about it and to make our lives
1,interventions are merely window dressing for ideological biases that are preexisting in the case of the researchers which is a very harsh statement and
1,of people enthusiastic about really looking critically at how we do things on a daytoday basis and figure out a better way to do
1,the 1930s very unhealthy shift in the line between government and business in particular actually acquiring government control of general motors gm by the
1,poor who are not allowed to be served by bare bones but effective and lowcost services russ what about adverse selection you mentioned that
1,of doing things then there is a sense of being able to optimize within that and maybe tinker with some of the incentiveswhich interventionist
1,even if i have some savings it means ive been successful at something and yes they are willing to credit me it means theyll

1,a most insignificant part of it in the race for wealth and honours and preferments he may run as hard as he can and
1,then they wouldnt have any incentive to do them and you wont get much innovation in the first place exactly right now theres lots
1,imaginations triggered rewarding to talk with students on this side of the water who have been involved maybe been to uganda how many have

1,picture of somebody surfing an east coast surfer who gets to surf the equivalent of a west coast wave doesnt happen very often in
1,us russ so getting back on track the bottom line of what you are saying is we know the sign of these relationships we
1,can take a healthy colony and you can split it you can buy purchase a queen from specialized beekeepers who do nothing but produce
1,not a high proportion but many numerically that actually work on something more like a commercial loan where ill borrow 200 and pay it
1,that his fans were upset and he responded 857 but as you point out the bandwidth wasnt very big some people could let him
1,rewarded i kind of think wall streets kind of hopeless at this pointtheyve kind of gone back to the bad old ways they make
1,if say the poorestperforming teachers were taken out of the classroom and what you put back in was roughly the average quality and the
1,date because temperatures changed and something sensitive that you are wearing or carrying what i found fascinating about thatim a little skeptical about its
1,that real consumer outlay fell from 19411943 didnt get back to 1941 level till 1946 consumers were worse off but not the whole story
1,out so i think theres grounds for cautious optimism about the future and people becoming foodies probably will make this issue better rather than
1,regression analysis part of the problem is we cant measure the magnitudes very well bottom line from macro perspective it didnt help very much
1,of why we in the united states today are still many many times the per capita income of china as a whole which is

1,about that process that requires administrators to do anyone can create a new article and move some of those things over what is cultural
1,come away thinking otherwise people dont even know what economists think why dont they know so hyper so upset that they are unable to
1,job are men thats because they are so stupid and careless roy sorry we are going to keep that tone out of this podcast
1,overwhelming that your whole body just collapses the way an organism worksit just collapses so there is this whole rethinking now going on about
1,and i said thats kind of funny i wonder why that is and it was at the same time that i discovered larry iannaccones
1,which are still present when the parents can exercise that control and accountability and in the innercity schools we have a social problem that
1,means there are people getting away with stuff others arent people complain about barry bonds the pitchers were using steroids its just bizarre guest
1,you present i think singapore is number 1 am i getting that right guest well it varies by who you include in the last
1,hasnt been increasingi went to another site and found that thats not the case or maybe there is something else that has changed that
1,out over rival business models enormously productive innovation that comes out of that seen it time after time trying to micromanage the direction of

1,act of 1845 as an ideal system and makes it clear that in that kind of decentralized monetary system you dont need a lender
1,i think this is important for a couple of reasons one is i see it as a kind of embedded rehabilitation of the idea
1,of the old world and the new results predicted depression predicted that men and women will overthrow civilization long historical perspective what would have
1,something where i actually really feel strongly that this is something that a lot of women in that age group ive watched them do
1,things under the guise of thinking we are making progress guest right russ so you do have to be careful where do you think
1,are required to communicate what they know 3403 use of knowledge in societyread it but didnt understand it till had to teach it comparative
1,for their kids they also want to have really good schools for their kids and they also want maybe want their kids to go

1,getting more sophisticated all the time we always hope for new documents especially from athensthe athenians were sort of document mad happily they liked
1,19732004 its only gone up 2030 in the last decade its actually declined there has not been net jobs growth in the last decade
1,order to get that single result but the other thing that it raises because theres many occasions in psychology just like you are describing
1,a case that the mmr vaccine causes autism they abandoned the lawsuit and went off into the distance the lawsuit was then exported across
1,or the occasional journalist and they would be like other you know heterodox political groups including marxists leftwing social democrats communitarians but none of
1,wrote down all the laws and we just follow them or the committee or the politburo this is created and given rise to by
1,molotov the other of course molotov simply following stalins orders ends with a unity statements so the central committee could be told the politburo
1,of powder cocaine and when we think about who was more likely even going back into the late 1970s early 1980s who was more
1,past experiencethis was a question was can you modify someones impression of a political candidate based on the sorts of answers you show him
1,stabilizing and we were pulling off that awful path of the great depression but there was a period of approximately six months when things
1,think what is unique to the last 50 60 years is kind of the hubris involved in our mistakes and the scale of them
1,to auto demand had a lot to do with sudden energy prices big deal for us auto sector lost jobs lost income consumption spending
1,touted and still tout imperfect property rights in poor countries collateral hernando de soto microfinance small loans person by person what about china and
1,innovation its great to free up the young people who have lots of freedom portable fellowships students would vote with their feet hard to

1,the great depression and let the money supply collapse it was really a punctuation mark about the great moderation saying we learned about that
1,coffee because you have a dollar in your pocket if somebody wants to sell you coffee so i think we need to break that
1,they obviously wield a lot of power and once theres a lot of them you start to get into the question of what they
