2,and you are the easiest person to fool its
2,it is led by a reasonably enlightened group of
2,the function of the philosophy of science to tell
2,but without the division of labor there can be
2,the other point i want to make which i
2,smith division of labor is limited by the extent
2,invest in google and you invest in the 100
2,if they dont do that they are not going
2,trading as a more equitable means of maximizing individual
2,state laws that constrain the companies didnt fight them
2,abridges the privileges or immunities of the citizens of
2,emotions in order to live simultaneously within different kinds
2,and i have talked about this before on the
2,little bit to the left of the house delegation
2,to smash it and through your own hubrisit just
2,what to do and i know a lot of
2,slack in some sectors as a general glut but
2,questions and involves becoming incredibly knowledgeable about these fields
2,of labor but without the division of labor there
2,want to go back to something you said a
2,might be a good thing might be a bad
2,to get back up to the trend line we
2,is this a good idea is this a good
2,i dont think you talk about in the book
2,orders according to different rules if we were to
2,what the rules of the game are going to
2,we must constantly adjust our lives our thoughts and
2,so i think theres a lot to be said
2,dont need their local banker like they used to
2,your neighbor over the head and take his stuff
2,dont know what to do and i know a
2,division of labor being limited by the extent of
2,many ways its one of the cruelest things in
2,for liberty private property public administration and the rule
2,is led by a reasonably enlightened group of people
2,going to be different and to take that dream
2,a little bit to the left of the house
2,but sea levels have been rising for several centuries
2,if any is left for parents to be increasing
2,just its so depressing partly because those arguments tend
2,dont put all your eggs in one basket and
2,what are your thoughts on that guest well i
2,party might like the book some people in the
2,be in prison or jail than are whites or
2,engage in substantial gainful activity in the us economy
2,piece has a principle of motion of its own
2,group of people set their hearts on fire saying
2,really there somebody would have picked it up already
2,they dont need their local banker like they used
2,easy to quit smoking ive done it a score
2,wealth of nations or the theory of moral sentiments
2,you invest in the 100 losers you are a
2,house collapses and kills the owner of the house
2,through your own hubrisit just its so depressing partly
2,i think a lot of people have a romance
2,and we are not going to be able to
2,but they have one friend in common which is
2,the unmodified uncurbed rules of the microcosmos ie of
2,venture capitalist who had the opportunity to invest in
2,set their hearts on fire saying im going to
2,will be done who will work how will compensation
2,it and through your own hubrisit just its so
2,to be different and to take that dream which
2,and i dont think we have a very good
2,jumping off point we are going to use a
2,simultaneously within different kinds of orders according to different
2,the privileges or immunities of the citizens of the
2,task of economics is to illustrate to men how
2,an occupation where some people are better than others
2,will ask the builder to cut corners otherwise they
2,the basic principle of banking which is know your
2,every venture capitalist who had the opportunity to invest
2,yourself and that is increasingly hard as science becomes
2,recipients of public services are going to get squeezed
2,it a sin to sell something for more than
2,and moneyand your lives are going to be different
2,the united states is the only country that has
2,be some equilibrium people will ask the builder to
2,all the different members of it are bound together
2,some sectors as a general glut but some sectors
2,friend in common which is the financial sector and
2,best way to think about teaching is to think
2,in many waysand you concede that the program had
2,google and you invest in the 100 losers you
2,to be some equilibrium people will ask the builder
2,rich people are happier than poor people the second
2,up to the trend line we were on before
2,said its easy to quit smoking ive done it
2,but when it is led by a reasonably enlightened
2,the macrocosmos our wider civilisation as our instincts and
2,right questions and involves becoming incredibly knowledgeable about these
2,magic of expertise and wisdom and moneyand your lives
2,im going to change your life theres magic comingits
2,russ lets shift gears i want to talk about
2,as a more equitable means of maximizing individual satisfaction
2,other point i want to make which i think
2,deposit insurance or other federal government protection or guarantees
2,so you have to find a solution to that
2,it works even if you dont believe in it
2,to that in a second but i want to
2,out of the 18th century and put him in
2,in some sectors as a general glut but some
2,friends but they have one friend in common which
2,collapses and kills the owner of the house the
2,troop or of say our families to the macrocosmos
2,program had some positive effectsbut in many ways its
2,and get your reaction to it which is that
2,that a large sheepskin effect would show that signaling
2,everyone took for granted that a large sheepskin effect
2,back up to the trend line we were on
2,they spend a bit of it to get more
2,dream which every human being has of a better
2,is only one social science and we are its
2,and through your own hubrisit just its so depressing
2,large sheepskin effect would show that signaling was important
2,we know a lot about how much difference there
2,chuck williams dean of butler universitys college of business
2,was very poorly received in the united states and
2,constrain the companies didnt fight them state by state
2,our wider civilisation as our instincts and sentimental yearnings

2,thats why they are asking for scaling up the
2,of orders according to different rules if we were
2,we were to apply the unmodified uncurbed rules of

2,of the book is based on the idea that
2,as competition arises from overseas the division of the
2,using the internet to increase their power and its
2,unmodified uncurbed rules of the microcosmos ie of the
2,and one of the things i talk about in
2,interesting point state laws that constrain the companies didnt
2,the earth been divided into equal portions among all

2,change your life theres magic comingits the magic of
2,band or troop or of say our families to
2,but before i do that i want you to
2,way to think about teaching is to think about
2,in that space between the individual and the state
2,to illustrate to men how little they really know
2,to apply the unmodified uncurbed rules of the microcosmos
2,part of the problem not part of the solution
2,or of say our families to the macrocosmos our
2,that there is a group of teachers at the
2,you concede that the program had some positive effectsbut
2,people to dig ditches and fill them back in
2,people the right questions and involves becoming incredibly knowledgeable
2,russ i want to come back to that in
2,some of them will have to do with public
2,so depressing partly because those arguments tend to win
2,human being has of a better life especially for
2,a hayek the curious task of economics is to
2,lot of inflation in the energy sector this year
2,relative to the assets that have been set aside
2,part of what jeffrey sachs does that i think
2,its one of the cruelest things in the world
2,children and to smash it and through your own

2,you have to take that into account you cant
2,going to have to figure out a way to
2,dont think thats the right way to think about
2,who cant get out of bed in the morning
2,to laertes neither a borrower nor a lender be
2,say it works even if you dont believe in
2,we dont have a thermometer that can tell us
2,or troop or of say our families to the

2,but if they dont have it when i get

2,to quit smoking ive done it a score of
2,laws that constrain the companies didnt fight them state
2,among young black men who have dropped out of
2,a lot of inflation in the energy sector this
2,im going to read another quote from the book
2,they just have different friends but they have one
2,and recipients of public services are going to get
2,no division of labor but without the division of

2,better life especially for their children and to smash
2,hearts on fire saying im going to change your
2,the right people the right questions and involves becoming
2,and to take that dream which every human being
2,to give the listeners a little bit of the
2,be in prison or jail than are women africanamericans
2,theres been a lot of inflation in the energy
2,what are your thoughts on that guest well this
2,much room if any is left for parents to
2,them state by state as competition arises from overseas
2,question is how much should i charge for it
2,its so depressing partly because those arguments tend to
2,how little they understand about what they imagine they
2,some equilibrium people will ask the builder to cut
2,to think about what would you do if you
2,of the microcosmos ie of the small band or
2,there is only one social science and we are
2,difficulty is that we must constantly adjust our lives
2,virgins get to talking the end is in sight
2,that we were going to run out of oil
2,and i know many people over the age of
2,can master in college to think otherwise is the
2,point i want to make which i think is
2,is you must not fool yourself and you are
2,a better life especially for their children and to
2,have to take that into account you cant just
2,if they dont have it when i get there
2,of economics is to illustrate to men how little
2,go back to something you said a minute ago
2,but as you point out in the book a
2,topic for today is a recent article you wrote
2,constantly adjust our lives our thoughts and our emotions
2,is an occupation where some people are better than
2,for their children and to smash it and through
2,the students who go to the ivy league schools
2,makes it harder for other people to play the
2,it harder for other people to play the game
2,state as competition arises from overseas the division of
2,they have one friend in common which is the
2,about these fields yourself and that is increasingly hard
2,master in college to think otherwise is the pretense
2,russ our topic for today is your book the
2,were to apply the unmodified uncurbed rules of the
2,their money back 100 cents on the dollar because
2,becoming incredibly knowledgeable about these fields yourself and that
2,to live simultaneously within different kinds of orders according
2,small band or troop or of say our families
2,think that the best way to think about teaching
2,we would destroy it yet if we were always
2,f a hayek the curious task of economics is
2,sectors as a general glut but some sectors are
2,insight that the division of labor is limited by
2,sell something for more than it is worth and
2,this a good idea is this a good idea
2,to live in a world where its okay to
2,that among young black men who have dropped out
2,balance the budget over the life of the business
2,wanting to claim that you can make things better
2,kinds of orders according to different rules if we
2,say our families to the macrocosmos our wider civilisation
2,of labor being limited by the extent of the
2,our families to the macrocosmos our wider civilisation as
2,our thoughts and our emotions in order to live
2,they both like to give money to their friends
2,think a lot of people have a romance about
2,what are firms but why are there firms and
2,a lot about how much difference there is between
2,the house collapses and kills the owner of the
2,are more valuable than they used to be which
2,by the way i dont want to suggest that
2,our topic for today is a recent article you
2,different friends but they have one friend in common
2,different rules if we were to apply the unmodified
2,wants to be loved and to be lovely we
2,saying im going to change your life theres magic
2,will be most comfortable talking about it in terms
2,the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia which
2,dont pay people enough you are not going to
2,would destroy it yet if we were always to
2,trying to do in this book is to say
2,you want to see him be able to take
2,of dying on the job and everyone else has
2,know what to do and i know a lot
2,you dont put all your eggs in one basket
2,dont want to be ruled by the majority rule
2,especially for their children and to smash it and
2,what jeffrey sachs does that i think is so
2,a reasonably enlightened group of people as china is
2,and kills the owner of the house the architect
2,thats too much im not going to pay that
2,that china is going to get ahead of us
2,that the best way to think about teaching is
2,people set their hearts on fire saying im going
2,are unable to engage in substantial gainful activity in
2,because the more people you can exchange with the
2,of the things i talk about in the book
2,by a reasonably enlightened group of people as china
2,twain said its easy to quit smoking ive done
2,that dream which every human being has of a
2,law that abridges the privileges or immunities of the
2,fortresses and virgins get to talking the end is
2,is left for parents to be increasing the similarity
2,things that are the product of human action but
2,there is a group of teachers at the bottom
2,privileges or immunities clause of the 14th amendment which
2,dont be so arrogant to think that you can
2,to report on what they did with the money
2,our instincts and sentimental yearnings often make us wish
2,own hubrisit just its so depressing partly because those
2,waysand you concede that the program had some positive
2,there are things that are the product of human
2,dont necessarily take the job that pays the most
2,yet in many waysand you concede that the program
2,ways its one of the cruelest things in the
2,more valuable than they used to be which is
2,18 part of our present difficulty is that we
2,lot of people thought it would be killed by
2,little bit not a lot but a little bit
2,people will ask the builder to cut corners otherwise
2,that getting the united states off the gold standard
2,got to make the case you cant just say
2,you can master in college to think otherwise is
2,look like the students who go to the ivy
2,franklin when fortresses and virgins get to talking the
2,to live in two sorts of world at once
2,jeffrey sachs does that i think is so destructive
2,1 in 10 chance that we are going to
2,moneyand your lives are going to be different and
2,that the program had some positive effectsbut in many
2,ferguson things that are the result of human action
2,russ but as you point out in the book
2,would balance the budget over the life of the
2,its easy to quit smoking ive done it a
2,careful to come on time and if he charges
2,i think its more than that i think its
2,the builder to cut corners otherwise they cant afford
2,life especially for their children and to smash it
2,in the fifth book of the wealth of nations
2,the more i thought about it the more i
2,unable to engage in substantial gainful activity in the
2,like the students who go to the ivy league
2,what do you have in mind when you say
2,the pie is not as big as it could
2,point state laws that constrain the companies didnt fight
2,hayek said the curious task of economics is to
2,that abridges the privileges or immunities of the citizens
2,i take your point and i think its a
2,a lot of people thought it would be killed
2,to cut corners otherwise they cant afford the house
2,know a lot about how much difference there is
2,were going to talk about a number of issues
2,at george mason when i look to the future
2,that constrain the companies didnt fight them state by
2,when it is led by a reasonably enlightened group
2,some of them will do it because of the
2,every human being has of a better life especially
2,into trading as a more equitable means of maximizing
2,much more likely to be in prison or jail
2,a general glut but some sectors are healthy only

2,you have to find a solution to that and
2,russ our topic for today is a recent article
2,hit it on the fat part of the bat
2,different kinds of orders according to different rules if
2,granted that a large sheepskin effect would show that
2,increasingly hard as science becomes increasingly networked and crossdisciplined
2,be a good thing might be a bad thing

2,see how much room if any is left for
2,got to be some equilibrium people will ask the
2,of a better life especially for their children and
2,back 100 cents on the dollar because jp morgan
2,companies didnt fight them state by state as competition
2,be most comfortable talking about it in terms of
2,advice to laertes neither a borrower nor a lender

2,all the videos and 300 did all the work
2,and you invest in the 100 losers you are

1,are a lot more people living together and sharing
1,do we do this quiz how do we do
1,got most of the aca so what do we
1,really failed and its incredibly destructive and yes the
1,does not mean that the consequences for society will
1,include people by the way with super quality health
1,this high scale could be a feature efficient school
1,are benevolent but it could be truethat we are
1,though when you think about local redistribution so i
1,hes also a fan of that also but we
1,out of business they are not going to be
1,central banks today they tried for a long time
1,public image their training what role do you play
1,but what it leaves out is when i make
1,people theyits middle management ideally that takes the successes
1,somehow theres this ceiling on government spending im all
1,econtalk as well guest that he very much regretted
1,money that would help i think make the world
1,them if its an american riding his bicycle he
1,later its too early guest theyre not too early
1,that would make it very expensive in some sense
1,and that is comparing it to family we all
1,are going to go out and buy gasoline youd
1,tremendous energy users theyve been in an environment where
1,banks would go under and demanded a price that
1,is they didnt overreact kept their policy steady didnt

1,country and his town estate he smokes a fiftycent
1,be as well unqualified teachers teachers working just for
1,they usually have anything to that argument no old
1,say they cant agree they dont go into recess
1,actually government policies that are simply more flexible this
1,comparative advantage when we have a boom what i
1,you can be a good peg to put in
1,up in the last podcast but i think a
1,these people are paid often by drug companies that
1,exists between counties is a very important one and
1,against a color tv and then what you do
1,simply charged a fixed production fee for each event
1,the respect of your fellow planters by looking down

1,does europeans happiness compare to americans ireland japan france
1,for you my mom had an occasional glass of
1,society with as much ease as the hand arranges
1,is extremely unrealistic i dont think there is any
1,years we are clearly very good at producing athletes
1,on your body through disease or work or something
1,is an interior maximum and i dont see that
1,wethere is a point in saying things that are

1,decision to allow the southern states to keep with
1,what does history suggest about the economic implications of
1,how complex it is and have tools that can
1,problem i would again say they werent really made
1,and that often is not the first company and
1,the problem because current taxpayers participants in the political
1,effect i mean in some ways its exactly why
1,on it theyve got the colors down they know
1,that human beings are altruistic and the wn says
1,19 times youd get a 95 if you voted
1,just be misplaced and that would mean that weve
1,years and millions of dollars in the odyssey so
1,lot of sugar are obviously people who smoke a
1,this neighborhood who used to live in this low
1,i had explained to them russ get it working
1,not participate than disclose this information wouldnt we be
1,think that it goes a bit beyond that and
1,think its a dogmatic aspect its how culture advances
1,agree on what the proposal will actually collect in
1,sounds a lot like fannie and freddieget this privilege
1,but suppose this is my week for the microfinance
1,something copied but no fax machine or modern copier
1,of predatory pricing actually working to hurt consumers of
1,does not violate the law unless you charge for
1,the nogales comparison is all about showing its about
1,people like hayek and from von mises so thats
1,moral foundation and then we can match that up
1,think is right and they think is awful guest
1,we can do tax or discourage these activities but
1,or they actually come away with the wrong point
1,children changed me but folks with children tend to
1,it all guest so its a feast or famine
1,rocky and say lets help mrs smith to get
1,created an industry in the applied financial domain what
1,long at all russ if we look at the
1,a zero sum game because the winners have to
1,had a private school system and the government is
1,20 states from 1920 until 1929 had relaxed their
1,assets will have to reprice them on their books
1,it right before tiger woods had his marital escapadesi
1,the entrenched winners of the current system whether its
1,we hadnt had fannie and freddie pushing to get
1,lifestyle by any stretch of the imagination however the
1,neither guest uh both all the survey data shows
1,to the ones that resonate with their innate personality
1,places where you can start getting something going you
1,in the discussion there was a huge increase in
1,project this project is coming to an end at
1,phd diploma and encourage them to stay and welcome
1,and these discount rates the only justification for using
1,dont die very much so they are going to
1,into the distance abstract theorizing fades suddenly relevant should
1,bad but from the point of view of the
1,group but leftist coalition the midnight of the century
1,one response is i actually think there is a
1,like those parsimonious explanations they are not always right
1,to win the war in vietman crazy when you
1,got to say its weird because they are more
1,glorious as i should mention here in april as
1,thanksgiving is coming you and i seem to be
1,saying those movers are representative of all americans but
1,where i came from because i was never in
1,of bitcoin transactions happening every second that will be
1,pinto on firm ground saying that fannie and freddie
1,late and pay the 10 this is something which
1,a long enough time period that you could at
1,the casethe internet lets you do it in public
1,that is often neglected in peoples reading and understanding
1,work out you hunt to eat empirically people are
1,and collectively to go ahead with those russ and
1,press oh treasury is telling me this that type
1,noncompetitive rights in the case of canada there is
1,major impediment to this kind of regulation they could
1,well so there is a question what is the
1,can trace it back way further than thatand the
1,a meter there but for either cultural or convenience
1,of libertarianism but i think the worst strand is
1,changes the costs and benefits at the time ongoing
1,norms emerge and get passed on nonspecific reciprocityseems like
1,same obviously ups and downs question in the real
1,which is ignored usually in those measures but the
1,about consumers than about profits some of it is
1,utility or the pure rate of time preference simply
1,makes some sensea germ of truth or more in
1,the amount of money they have to lend from
1,were doing it they didnt do it as much
1,a world like this overall the entire world is
1,to fertility but thats transitioning 3301 business cycles macroeconomics
1,of the money they had used to make their
1,out the easy and trivial examples are like priceline
1,well lets talk about the outsider because thats another
1,what they know and so i think the biggest
1,that so thats where the evidence is a bit
1,prosperity and you focus on the issue of trust
